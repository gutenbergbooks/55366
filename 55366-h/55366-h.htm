<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<div class="dropcap">
<img src="images/dropcapa.jpg" alt="A" width="75" height="74" />
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcapa">large</span> class of people, by force of
circumstances, are compelled to treat
their own animals when sick or disabled.
Qualified veterinarians are
not always available; and all the
ills and accidents incident to farm
animals do not require professional attendance.
Furthermore, the skilled stockman should be
familiar with common diseases and the treatment
of them. He should remember, too, that the maintenance
of health and vigor in our farm stock is
the direct result of well-directed management. Too
frequently this is neither understood nor admitted,
and an unreasonable lack of attention, when
animals are ill or indisposed, works out dire mischief
in the presence of physical disorder and infectious
diseases. A fair acquaintance with the
common ailments is helpful to the owner and to
his stock. This leads to health, to prevention of
disease, and to skill in attendance when disease is
at hand.</p>

<p>The volume herewith presented abounds in helpful
suggestions and valuable information for the
most successful treatment of ills and accidents and
disease troubles. It is an everyday handbook
of disease and its treatment, and contains the best
ideas gathered from the various authorities and
the experience of a score of practical veterinarians
in all phases of veterinary practice.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION<br />
<span class="chapname">Facing Disease on the Farm</span></h2>

<p>To call a veterinarian or not&mdash;that is the question.
Whether your horse or cow is sick enough
for professional attendance, or just under the
weather a little, is a problem you will always be
called upon to face. And you must meet it. It
has always faced the man who raises stock, and it
is a problem that always will. Like human beings,
farm stock have their ailments and troubles; and,
in most cases, a little care and nursing are all that
will be required. With these troubles all of us are
acquainted; especially those who have spent much
time with the flocks and the herds on the farm.
Through experience we know that often with every
reasonable care, some animals, frequently the
healthiest-looking ones, in the field, or stable, give
trouble at the most unsuspected times. So the
fault is not always with the owner.</p>

<p>There is no reason, however, why an effort should
not be made, just as soon as any trouble is noticed,
to assist the sick animal to recover, and help
nature in every way possible to restore the invalid
to its usual normal condition. The average observing
farmer, as a rule, knows just about what the
trouble is; he usually knows if treatment is beyond
him, and if not, what simple medical aid will be
effective in bringing about a recovery with greater
dispatch than nature unaided will effect.</p>

<p>Now, of course, this means that the farmer
should be acquainted with his animals; in health
and disease their actions should be familiar to him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
If he be a master of his business he naturally
knows a great deal about his farm stock. No man
who grows corn or wheat ever raises either crop
extremely successfully unless he has an intimate
knowledge of the soil, the seed, the details of fertilization
and culture. He has learned how good
soils look, how bad soils look; he knows if soils
are healthy, whether they are capable of producing
big crops or little crops.</p>

<p>So with his stock. He must know, and he does
know, something as to their state of health or ill
health. With steady observation his knowledge
will increase; and with experience he ought to be
able to diagnose the common ailments, and not
only prescribe for their treatment, but actually treat
many of them himself. Unfortunately, many farmers
pass health along too lightly and the common
disorders too seriously. This is wrong. The man
who deals with farm animals should be well
acquainted with them, just as the engineer is acquainted
with his engine. If an engine goes wrong
the engineer endeavors to ascertain the trouble. If
it is beyond his experience and knowledge he turns
the problem over to an expert. It should be so
with the stock raiser. So familiar should the owner
be with his animals in case of trouble he ought
to know of some helpful remedy or to know that
the trouble is more serious than ordinary, in which
case the veterinarian should be called.</p>

<p>All of this means that the art of observing the
simple functions should be acquired at the earliest
possible moment&mdash;where to find the pulse of horse
or cow, how many heart beats in a minute, how
many respirations a minute, the color of the healthy
nostril, the use of the thermometer and where to
place it to get the information, the character of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
eye, the nature of the coat, the passage of dung and
water, how the animal swallows, the attitude when
standing, the habit of lying down and getting up&mdash;all
of these should be as familiar to the true stockman
as the simplest details of tillage or of planting
or of harvesting.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500p" id="Fig2">
<img src="images/illo003.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="372" />
<p class="caption main">COMMON SHEEP SCAB</p>
<p class="caption sublong">Here is an advanced case and shows how serious the
trouble may become. A very small itch mite is the cause. The
mites live and multiply under the scurf and scab of the skin.</p>
</div>

<p>Moreover, the stockman should be a judge of
external characters, whether natural or temporary.
He should have a knowledge of animal conformation.
If to know a good plow is desirable, then to
know a good pastern or foot is desirable. If the
art of selecting wheat is a worthy acquisition, then
the art of comparing hocks of different horses is a
worthy accomplishment also. If experience tells
the grower that his corn or potatoes or cotton is
strong, vigorous and healthy or just the reverse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
observation and experience ought also to tell him
when his stock are in good health or when they
lack thrift or are sick and need treatment.</p>

<h3>LEARN TO RECOGNIZE ANIMAL DISEASES</h3>

<p>Few farmers there are, indeed, who are not
acquainted with crop diseases. Smut is readily
recognized when present in the wheat or corn or
oat field; so colic, too, should be recognized when
your horse is affected by it. The peach and the
apple have their common ailments; so have the
cow and pig. In either case the facts ought to be
familiar. So familiar that as soon as diagnosed
and recognized prompt measures for treatment
should be followed that the cure may be effected
before any particular headway is at all made.
Handled in this way, many cases that are now
passed on to the veterinarian would never develop
into serious disturbances at all.</p>

<h3>PREVENTION BETTER THAN CURE</h3>

<p>The old saying, &#8220;Prevention is better than cure,&#8221;
is both wisdom and a splendid platform on which
to build any branch of live stock work. Every disease
is the result of some disturbance, somewhere.
It may be improper food; the stockman must know.
Moldy fodder causes nervous troubles in the horse.
Cottonseed meal, if fed continuously to pigs, leads
to their death. Hence, food has much to do with
health and disease. Ventilation of the stable plays
its part. Bad air leads to weakness, favors tuberculosis,
and, if not remedied, brings about loss and
death. Fresh air in abundance is better than medicine;
and the careful stockman will see that it be
not denied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span></p>

<p>Good sanitation, including cleanly quarters,
wholesome water and dry stables, has its reward in
more healthy animals. When not provided, the
animals are frequently ill, or are in bad health more
or less. As these factors&mdash;proper food, good ventilation,
and effective sanitation&mdash;are introduced in
stable accommodations, diseases will be lessened
and stock profits will increase.</p>

<p class="caption main">HOG HOUSE AND FEEDING FLOOR</p>
<p class="caption sublong">This convenient hog house is inexpensive, and the feeding
floor at the side insures cleanliness and thorough sanitary
conditions. A sanitary hog house should be one of the
chief improvements of the farm.</p>
</div>

<h3>DISINFECT FREQUENTLY; IT NEVER
HURTS AND IT MAY DO A WORLD
OF GOOD</h3>

<p>As disease is better understood it becomes more
closely identified with germs and bacteria. Hence,
to lessen disease we must destroy, so far as possible,
the disease-producing germs. For this
purpose nothing is better than sunlight and disinfectants.
Sunlight is itself death to all germs;
therefore, all stables, and the living quarters for farm
animals, should be light and airy, and free from
damp corners and lodgment places for dust, vermin,
and bacteria. Even when animals are in good<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
health, disinfection is a splendid means for warding
off disease. For sometimes with the greatest
care germs are admitted in some manner or form.
By constantly disinfecting, the likelihood of any
encroachment by germs is greatly lessened.</p>

<p>Fortunately we have disinfectants that are easily
applied and easily obtained at small cost. One of
these disinfecting materials is lime, just ordinary
slaked lime, the lime that every farmer knows.
While it does not possess the disinfecting power
of many other agents, it is, nevertheless, very desirable
for sprinkling about stables and for whitewashing
floors, walls, and partitions. When so
used the cracks and holes are filled and the germs
destroyed. Ordinary farm stables should be whitewashed
once or twice each year, and the crumbled
lime sprinkled on the litter or open ground. It is
not desirable to use lime with bedding and manure,
for the reason that it liberates the nitrogen contained
therein. Hence the bedding and manure
should be removed to the fields as frequently as
possible, where it can be more helpful to the land.
Thus scattered, the sunlight and purifying effects
of the soil will soon destroy the disease bacteria,
if any are present in the manure.</p>

<p>Another splendid disinfectant is corrosive sublimate,
mercuric chloride, as it is often called. Use
one ounce in eight gallons of water. This makes
one-tenth of one per cent solution. In preparing
this disinfectant, allow the material to stand for
several hours, so as to permit the chemical to become
entirely dissolved. This solution should be
carefully guarded and protected, since it is a poison
and, if drunk by animals, is liable to cause death.
If infected quarters are to be disinfected, see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
the loose dirt and litter is first removed before
applying the sublimate.</p>

<p>Carbolic acid is another satisfactory disinfectant.
Usually a five per cent solution is recommended.
It can be easily applied to mangers, stalls, and feed
boxes. Enough should be applied so that the wood
or iron is made wet and the cracks and holes more
or less filled. Chloride of lime is a cheap and an
easily prepared disinfectant. Use ten ounces of
chloride of lime to two gallons of water. This
makes a four per cent solution, and should be applied
in the same way as the corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p>Formalin has come into prominence very recently
as a desirable disinfectant. A five per cent solution
fills the bill. Floors and cracks should be
made thoroughly wet with it. By using one or
more of these agents the living quarters of farm
animals can be kept wholesome, sweet, and free
from germ diseases. In fact, the use of disinfectants
is one of the best aids of the farmer in warding
off disease and in lessening its effects when once
present.</p>

<h3>PUT SICK ANIMALS OFF BY THEMSELVES</h3>

<p>Many diseases are introduced into a herd or flock
by thoughtlessness on the part of the owner. I
have known distemper to be introduced into stables
and among horses, Texas fever and tuberculosis
into herds of cattle, and hog cholera among hogs,
because diseased animals, when purchased, were
not separated off by themselves, for a short time at
least. If this were done, farmers would lessen the
chance of an introduction of disease into their
healthy herds. Consequently quarantine quarters
should be provided; especially is this true if new<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
animals are frequently purchased and brought
to the farm where many animals are raised
and handled. These quarantine quarters need not
be expensive, and they ought to be removed far
enough from the farm stock so that there may be
no easy means of infection. When newly purchased
animals are placed in the quarantine quarters
they should be kept there long enough to
determine if anything strange or unusual is taking
place.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<span class="chapname">How the Animal Body is Formed</span></h2>

<p>The cell is the unit of growth. It is so with all
forms of life&mdash;plant or animal, insect or bacterium.
In the beginning the start is with a single cell, an
egg, if you please. After fertilization has taken
place, this single cell enlarges or grows. Many
changes now occur, all rather rapidly, until the cell
walls become too small, when it breaks apart and
forms two cells just like the first used to be. This
is known as cell division. As growth increases, the
number of cells increases also&mdash;until in the end
there are millions.</p>

<h3 class="inline">Nature of the Cell.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The cell is very small. In
most cases it cannot be seen with the naked eye.
The microscope is necessary for a study of the
parts, the nature and the character of the cell.</p>

<p>In the first place the cell is a kind of inclosed
sac, in which are found the elements of growth
and life. Surrounding the cell is a thin wall known
as the cell membrane. In plants this cell wall is
composed of cellulose, a woody substance, which
is thin and tender in green and growing plants, but
hard and woody when the plant is mature.</p>

<p>Within the limits of the cell is the protoplasm,
the chief constituent of the cell; locked up in this
protoplasm is life, the vital processes that have to
do with growth, development, individual existence.</p>

<p>Embedded within the protoplasm is another part
known as the nucleus and recognized under the
microscope by its density. Around the nucleus is<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
centered the development of new cells or reproduction&mdash;for
the changes that convert the mother-cell
into offspring-cells are first noted in this place.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500p" id="Fig5">
<img src="images/illo010.png" alt="" width="500" height="383" />
<p class="caption main">HOW A CELL DIVIDES</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The simple steps in cell division are pictured here. Starting
with a single cell, growth and enlargement take place,
ending finally in cell division or the production of two
individual cells.</p>
</div>

<p>So much for plant cells. Is this principle different
in animals? For a long time it was thought
that plants and animals were different. But upon
investigation it was discovered that animals were
comprised of cells just as plants. And not only
was this discovered to be true, but also that animal
cells corresponded in all respects to plant cells.
Hence in animals are to be found cells possessing
the cell walls formed of a rather thick membrane,
the granular protoplasm or yoke, and the nucleus
established in the yoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span></p>

<p>The ovum, known as the female egg, is composed
of the parts just described. If it is not fertilized
when ripe it passes away and dies. If fertilized in
a natural way, it enlarges in size and subsequently
divides into two cells; and these, passing through
similar changes, finally give rise to the various
groups of cells from which the body is developed.</p>

<h3 class="inline">The Animal Body a Group Collection.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The body
is, therefore, a mass of cells; not all alike, of course,
but grouped together for the purpose of doing certain
special kinds of work. In this way we have
various groups, with each group a community performing
its own function. The brain forms one
community; and these cells are concerned with
mind acts. The muscle cells are busy in exerting
force and action. Another group looks after the
secretions and digestive functions, while another
group is concerned solely with the function of
generation and reproduction. And so it is throughout
the body.</p>

<p>Both individual cells and group cells are concerned
with disease. One cell may be diseased or
destroyed, but the surrounding ones may go on just
the same. It is when the group is disturbed that
the greatest trouble results.</p>

<h3 class="inline">A Word About the Cells.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The cell always possesses
its three parts&mdash;membrane, protoplasm, and
nucleus. But there is no rule as to the size or
shape. Cells may be round or oblong, any shape.
Substances pass in and out of the cell walls; and
they are in motion, many of them, especially those
that line the intestines and the air passages, and
the white corpuscles of the blood. More than this,
some cells, Dr. Jekyl-like, change their appearance
and shape, send out finger-like bodies to catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
enemies or food, and even travel all around in the
body, often leaving it altogether.</p>

<h3>BODY TISSUES</h3>

<p>The animal body contains five forms of tissues:
Epithelial, in which the cells are very compact,
forming either thin or thick plates; the connective
tissue, by which many organs are supported or
embedded; muscle tissue, either smooth or striated,
and in which the cells are in fibers that contract
and shorten; nerve-tissue, that has to do with nerve
and ganglion cells by which mental impulses are
sent; and blood and lymph tissue or fluid tissues.</p>

<p>The first group is intimately connected with the
secretory organs, or those organs which secrete
certain substances essential for the proper work of
the body. Thus we have salivary glands, mucous
glands, sweat glands, and the liver and pancreas.
Connective tissue includes fibrous tissue, fatty tissue,
cartilage and bone. The fibrous connective
tissue is illustrated when the skin is easily picked
up in folds. Fatty tissue occurs where large
amounts of fat are deposited in the cells. Cartilage
is found where a large amount of firm support is
required. With muscle we are all familiar; it is
the real lean meat of the body.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Blood and Lymph.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The blood is a fluid in
which many cells are to be found. The fluid is
known as serum or blood-plasma and the cells as
corpuscles, and are both red and white. The red
cells give the characteristic color. When observed
under a microscope, they appear as small, round
disks. They are of great importance to the body
work. Because of the coloring matter in them the
oxygen of the air is attracted when it comes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
contact with the blood in the lungs. Oxygen is in
reality absorbed, and on the blood leaving the lungs
it is distributed to all parts of the body. The oxygen
supply of the body is, therefore, in the keeping
of the red corpuscles.</p>

<p>White corpuscles have a different work; they
guard the body by picking up poison, bacteria, and
other undesirable elements and cast these out
through the natural openings of the body. Compared
with the red cells, they exist in far less numbers
and may wander about through all parts of
the body.</p>

<p>Lymph is a fluid in which a few cells, lymph
corpuscles, are suspended. These cells are very
much like the colorless corpuscles of the blood,
only no red blood cells are present. But the lymph
attends to its own business; it bathes the tissues
and endeavors to keep them in a healthy condition.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Skin and Hair.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Without a covering the delicate
muscles would be unprotected. The skin serves in
this capacity. It does still more; out of it is
exuded poisonous substances, perspiration, and, at
the same time, the skin is a sort of respiratory
organ, through which much of the carbonic acid
formed in the body escapes.</p>

<p>The skin possesses two general layers, the cutis
and sub-cutis; in the first is contained also
epidermis. Developed in the skin are the outer
coverings like hair, wool, feathers, horns, claws,
and hoofs.</p>

<h3>THE FRAMEWORK OF THE BODY</h3>

<p>The framework of the body undergoes a gradual
development from birth to maturity. It represents
the bony structure of the body; and on it all other<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
parts depend for support and protection. The
brief summary of its parts and work that follows
here has been adapted from Wilcox and Smith.</p>

<h4 class="inline">The Skeleton.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This consists of a backbone,
skull, shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle, and two pairs
of appendages. The backbone may be conveniently
divided into regions, each comprising a certain
number of vertebr&aelig;. The cervical vertebr&aelig;
include those from the skull from the first rib. In
all mammals except the sloth and sea cow the number
of cervical vertebr&aelig; is seven, being long or
short, according as the neck of the animal is relatively
long or short. The first and second cervical
vertebr&aelig;, known as the atlas and axis, are especially
modified so as to allow free turning movements of
the head.</p>

<p>The next region includes the dorsal or thoracic
vertebr&aelig;, which are characterized by having ribs
movably articulated with them. The number is 13
in the cat, dog, ox, sheep, and goat; 14 in the
hog; 18 or 19 in the horse and ass, and six or seven
in domestic poultry. In mammals they are so
joined together as to permit motion in several directions,
but in poultry the dorsal vertebr&aelig; are more
rigidly articulated, those next to the sacrum often
being grown together with the sacrum. The
spines are high and much flattened in all ungulates,
long and slender in dogs and cats. They slope backward,
forming strong points of attachment for the
back muscles. Several ribs, varying in number in
different animals, meet and become articulated with
the breast bone or sternum. The sternum consists
of seven to nine articulated segments in our domestic
mammals, while in fowls the sternum is one
thin high bone furnished with a keel of varying
depth. The lumbar vertebr&aelig; lie between the dorsal<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
vertebr&aelig; and the sacrum. The number is five in the
horse, six in the hog, ox and goat, and seven in the
sheep. The sacrum is made up of a certain number
of vertebr&aelig;, which are rigidly united and
serve as an articulation for the pelvic arch. The
number of sacral vertebr&aelig; is five in the ox and
horse, four in sheep and hogs, and 12 to 17 in birds.
The caudal or tail vertebr&aelig; naturally vary in number
according to the length of the tail (7 to 10 in
sheep, 21 in the ox, 23 in hogs, 17 in the horse, 22
in the cat, 16 to 23 in the dog).</p>

<p>In ungulates the anterior ribs are scarcely curved,
the chest being very narrow in front. The number
of pairs of ribs is the same as the number of dorsal
vertebr&aelig; with which they articulate.</p>

<h4 class="inline">The Skull.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This part of the skeleton is really
composed of a number of modified vertebr&aelig;, just
how many is not determined. The difference in the
shape of the skulls of different animals is determined
by the relative size of the various bones of
the skull. In hogs, for example, the head has been
much shortened as a result of breeding, thus giving
the skull of the improved breeds a very different
appearance from that of the razorback.</p>

<p>The shoulder girdle consists of a shoulder blade,
collar bone and coracoid on either side. The fore
leg (or wing, in case of birds) articulates with the
socket formed by the junction of these three bones.
In all the ungulates the shoulder blade is high and
narrow, the coracoid is never much developed, and
the collar bone is absent. In fowls all three bones
of the shoulder girdle are well developed, the collar
bone being represented by the &#8220;wish bone.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="inline">The Pelvic Girdle.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This consists of three bones
on either side, viz., ilium, ischium, and pubis. The
first two are directly articulated to the spinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]<br /><a id="Page17">[17]</a></span>
column, while the pubic bones of either side unite
below to complete the arch. The three bones of
each side of the pelvis are present in all our
domestic animals, including the fowls.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<h4 class="inline">Legbones of Farm Animals.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;There is one
formula for the bones of the fore and hind legs of
farm animals. The first segment is a single bone,
the humerus of the fore leg, femur of the hind leg.
In the next segment there are two bones, radius
and ulna in the fore leg, tibia and fibula in the hind
leg. In the dog, cat, and Belgian hare the radius
and ulna are both well developed and distinct. In
ungulates the humerus is short and stout, while
the ulna is complete in the pig, rudimentary and
behind the radius in ruminants and firmly united
with the radius in the horse. Similarly with the
hind leg the fibula is a complete bone in the pig,
while in the horse there is merely a rudiment of it,
attached to the tibia.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Feet.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The mammalian skeleton has undergone
the greatest modification in the bones of the feet.
In the horse there are only six of the original ten
wrist or carpal bones, and, since there is but one
of the original five toes, the horse has also but one
metacarpal or cannon bone. Splint-like rudiments
of two other metacarpal bones are to be found at
the upper end of the cannon bone, or at the &#8220;knee&#8221;
joint. Below the cannon bone, and forming the
shaft of the foot, we have the small cannon bone,
coronary bone, and coffin bone&mdash;the last being
within the hoof with the navicular bone behind it.
The stifle joint of the horse corresponds to the knee
of man. The &#8220;knee&#8221; of the horse&#8217;s fore leg corresponds
to the hock of the hind leg, both being at
the upper end of the cannon bone. The fetlock
joint is between the large and small cannon bones,<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
the pastern joint between the small cannon or large
pastern bones, and the coffin joint between the
coronary and coffin bones. The horse walks upon
what corresponds to the nail of the middle finger
and middle toe of man.</p>

<p>In pigs four digits touch the ground, the first
being absent and the third and fourth larger and in
front of the second and fifth. In ruminants the
third and fourth digits reach the ground, while the
second and fifth do not. In dogs the first digit
appears on the side of the leg, not in contact with
the ground.</p>

<p class="caption subshort">The thorn-headed worm attached to the anterior part
of the small intestine often causes death. Not more than
five or six are usually found in a single animal.</p>
</div>

<p>In fowls the wing, which corresponds to the fore
leg of mammals, shows a well-developed humerus,
radius and ulna, while only one carpal and one
metacarpal bone remain, along which the wing
feathers are attached. In the leg the femur and
tibia are strong bones, but the fibula is a mere
splint. The tarsal bones are absent, while the
shank consists of a metatarsal bone (really three
bones fused together), to which the four toes are
articulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline">The Muscular System of Farm Animals.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The
muscular system is too elaborate, the number of
muscles too great, and their modifications for different
purposes too complex for consideration in
detail in the present volume. All muscles are
either striped or unstriped (as examined under the
microscope), according as they are under the immediate
control of the will or not. The heart
muscle forms an exception, for it is striped though
involuntary. The essential characteristic of muscle
fibers is contractility, which they possess in high
degree. The typical striped muscles are concerned
in locomotion, being attached at either end to a
bone and extending across some movable joint.
The most important unstriped muscles are found in
the walls of the intestines and blood vessels.</p>

<h4 class="inline">The Nervous System.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;In so far as our present
purposes are concerned, the nervous system may
be disposed of in a few words. The central nervous
system consists of a brain and spinal cord.
The microscopic elements of this tissue are peculiarly
modified cells, consisting of a central body,
from which fibers run in two or more directions.
The cell bodies constitute the gray matter, and the
fibers the white matter of the brain and spinal cord.
The gray substance is inside the spinal cord and on
the surface of the brain, constituting the cortex.
The most important parts of the brain are the
cerebrum, optic lobes, cerebellum, and medulla.
There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves originating
in the brain and controlling the special senses,
movements of the face, respiration, and pulse rate.
From each segment of the spinal cord a pair of
spinal nerves arises, each of which possess both
sensory and motor roots. The sympathetic nervous
system consists of a trunk on either side, running<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
from the base of the skull to the pelvis, furnished
with ganglionic enlargements and connected with
the spinal nerves by small fibers.</p>

<h4 class="inline">The Respiratory Organs.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These include the
nose, larynx, trachea or windpipe, and lungs. The
trachea forks into bronchi and bronchioles of
smaller and smaller size, ending in the alveoli
or blind sacs of the lungs. In fowls there are
numerous extensions of the respiratory system
known as air sacs, and located in the body
cavity and also in the hollow bones. The air sacs
communicate with the lungs, but not with one another.</p>

<h4 class="inline">The Urinary Organs.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These consist of kidneys
connecting by means of ureters with a bladder from
which the urethra conducts the urine to the outside.
In the male the urethra passes through the
penis and in the female it ends just above the
opening of the vagina. The kidneys are usually
inclosed in a capsule of fat. The right kidney of
the horse is heart-shaped, the left bean-shaped.
Each kidney of the ox shows 15 to 20 lobes, and is
oval in form. The kidneys of sheep, goats, and
swine are bean-shaped and without lobes.</p>

<h4 class="inline">The Reproductive Apparatus.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This consists of
ovaries, oviducts, uterus or womb, and vagina in
the female; the testes, spermatic cords, seminal
vesicle and penis, together with various connecting
glands, especially prostate gland and Cowper&#8217;s
gland, in the male. In fowls there is no urinary
bladder, but the ureters open into the cloaca or
posterior part of the rectum. The vagina and
uterus are also wanting in fowls, the oviducts opening
directly into the rectum. The male copulating
organ is absent except in ducks, geese, swan, and
the ostrich.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="chapname">Some Physiology You Ought to Know</span></h2>

<p>A close relation exists between the soil, plant,
and the animal. One really cannot exist without
the other to fulfill its destiny. A soil without plant
or animal growth is barren, devoid of life. The
soil comes first; the elements contained in it and
the air are the basis of plant and animal life. The
body of the animal is made up of the identical
elements found in the plant, yet the growth of the
plant is necessary to furnish food for animal life.
The plant takes from the soil and from the air the
simple chemical elements, and with these builds up
the plant tissue which, in its turn, is the food of
the animal.</p>

<p>The animal cannot feed directly from the soil and
air; it requires the plant first to take the elements
and to build them into tissue. From this tissue
animals get their food for maintenance and growth.
Then the animal dies; with its decay and decomposition
comes change of animal tissue, back to
soil and air again; back to single simple elements,
that new plants may be grown, that new plant tissue
may be made for another generation of animal
life.</p>

<p>Thus the plant grows out of the soil and air,
and the decay of the animal plant life furnishes
food for the plant that the plant may furnish food
for the animal. Thus we see the cycle of life; from
the soil and air come the soil constituents.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Meaning of Plant Building.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Before the single
simple elements were taken into the plant, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]<br /><a id="Page23">[23]</a></span>
were of little value. The animal could not use
them for food, they could not be burned to furnish
heat, and they stored up no energy to carry on any
of the world&#8217;s work. What a change the plant
makes of them! So used, they become the source
of the animal food, and, as food, they contain five
principal groups with which the animal is nourished.
These five groups are the air, water, the
protein compounds, the nitrogen free compounds,
such as starch, crude fiber, sugar and gums, and
the fat or ether extract, as it is called.</p>

<h3>DIGESTION OF THE FOOD</h3>

<p>Before these different constituents of the plant
can be used as food for animals, they must be prepared
for absorption into the system of the animal.
This preparation takes place in the mouth, &#339;sophagus
tube, the stomach, and the intestines, aided
by the various secretions incident to digestion and
absorption. Any withholding of any essential constituent
has its result in inefficiency or illness of
the animal.</p>

<p>Withhold ash materials, for instance, from the
food, or supply an insufficient quantity, and the
fact will be evidenced by poor teeth, deficient bone
construction and poor health in general. Let the
feeding ration be short in protein, and the result
will be shown in the flesh and blood. Let the carbohydrates
and fat be withheld or supplied insufficiently,
and energy will be denied and a thrifty
condition will not be possible.</p>

<p>The supply of these different constituents in the
proper proportion gives rise to the balanced ration;
and is concerned in a treatise of this kind only in so
far as it has to do with disease or health. For,<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
remember this fact: live stock are closely associated
with right feeding. If foods be improperly
prepared, or improperly supplied, or the rations
poorly balanced, with too much of one constituent
and too little of another, the effect will be manifest
in an impoverished condition of the system. That
means either disease, or disease invited.</p>

<p>Not only must these facts be considered, but
other matters given recognition also. The greater
part of the trouble of the stockman in the way of
animal diseases is due to some disturbance of the
digestive system, or to the water supply, or to ventilation,
or to the use to which the animal is put from
day to day. Attention to the details of digestion
has its reward in thrifty, healthy stock; a lack of
this attention brings trouble and either a temporary
ailment or a permanent disease.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Process of Mastication.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Food is taken in the
mouth, where it is masticated by means of the teeth,
lips, cheeks, and the tongue. While the process of
mastication is taking place there is being poured
into the mouth large quantities of saliva, which
softens the food and starts the process of digestion.
The active principle of saliva is a soluble ferment,
called ptyalin, that converts the starch of
food into sugar. The amount of saliva that is
poured into the food is very great, being often as
much as one-tenth of the weight of the animal. This
ferment is active after the teeth have been formed,
which explains why it is not advisable to feed
much starchy food to children before their teeth
have begun development.</p>

<p>The food, after being ground and mixed with the
saliva fluid, goes to the stomach. With the horse
and hog the stomach is a single sac not capable
of holding very large quantities of food; with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
cow and sheep, on the other hand, we find a large
storehouse for holding food&mdash;a storehouse that is
divided into four compartments, the rumen or
paunch, reticulum, omasum, and the abomasum.
The first three communicate with the gullet by
a common opening. The cud is contained in the
first and second stomachs, and, after it has been
masticated a second time, it passes to the third and
fourth, and to the bowels, where the process of
digestion is continued.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500p" id="Fig9">
<img src="images/illo025.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="261" />
<p class="caption main">DISEASED KIDNEY</p>
<p class="caption subshort">The kidney of the hog is pictured here. As a rule it is
usually impossible to diagnose kidney troubles in hogs and
similar lower animals.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="inline">Gastric Juice.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;From this it will be noticed that
chewing the cud is an act in the process of digestion;
it refers only to rechewing the food so as to
get it finer and better ground for digestion. While
in the stomach the saliva continues the digestion
of the starchy matter and is assisted by the gastric
fluid that pours in from the lining of the stomach,
which converts the protein or albuminoids into
peptones. The fatty matter is not acted upon at
this point. There are three constituents of gastric
juice, which affect the changes in the food. These
are pepsin, rennet, and acid. With rennet you are
acquainted. It is used in the kitchen, in the making
of cheese, and is obtained from the stomach of<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
calves or other young animals. Pepsin, also obtained
directly from the stomach, is now a conspicuous
preparation in medicine. The food, after
leaving the stomach, goes into the bowels and is
acted upon by secretions of the liver and pancreas
or sweetbreads. It should be noted in passing that
no secretion enters the first three divisions of the
ruminant&#8217;s stomach. It is only in the fourth or
true stomach that the gastric juice is found.</p>

<h4 class="inline">The Stomach Churn.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;While food is in the
stomach it is subjected to a constant turning movement
that causes it to travel from the entrance to
the exit or intestines. When it passes into the small
intestines it is subjected to the action of bile
and pancreatic juices, which have principally
to do with the breaking up of the fat compounds.
Both resemble, to a certain extent, saliva in their
ability to change starch into sugar.</p>

<p>The secretion of the bile comes from the liver
and the pancreatic juice from the pancreas or
sweetbreads, and both are poured into the intestines
near the same point, so that they act together. The
ferments they contain act in the following ways:
They change starch into sugar, fat into fatty compounds,
they curdle milk, and convert protein compounds
into soluble peptones.</p>

<p>The process of digestion is finally ended in the
intestines, where absorption into the system takes
place. There is no opening at all from the bowels
into the body, but the digestive nutriment is picked
up by the blood when handed into the body from
the intestines by means of countless little cells
called villi, that line the walls of the intestines.
These villi cells have little hair-like projections extending
into the intestines, which constantly move;
these protrusions, as they move about, catch on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
the digested nutriment, draw it into the cells themselves,
where it is handed on to the blood, when it
is later on distributed to all parts of the body. You
can realize that an immense number of these absorption
cells are present when the length of the
intestine is considered. In the ox the intestine is
nearly 200 feet long. After the nutriment is drawn
from the food the undigested portions are voided
periodically as feces or dung.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450p" id="Fig10">
<img src="images/illo027.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="355" />
<p class="caption main">STOMACH OF RUMINANT</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The four main divisions of the ruminant&#8217;s stomach are
pictured here. The first three divisions are the store-houses
for food until it is fully prepared for the fourth stomach or
abomasum.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="inline">Absorption of the Nutriment.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Digestion, therefore,
is a dissolving process; food is admitted to
the system by means of cells. You remember that<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
all plant food first passes into a soluble state before
it can enter the roots and be conveyed to the
parts of the plants that require additional food for
growth. In the case of plants the entrance is by
means of the root hairs. In the case of the animal,
entrance in the body is by means of the villi cells
that line the intestines. From this we see that
digestion is both an intricate and delicate process.
Any loss of appetite, any disturbance of the digestion
work, and any irregularity of the bowels bear
decided results, one way or the other, to the rest
of the system; and any disturbance of the body at
other points, although having no direct relation to
the digestion system, sooner or later affects the
digestion and in so doing causes additional trouble.</p>

<p>Directly affecting digestion may be improper
food, either liquid or solid; and over-exercise or
not enough of it may prove troublesome, for exercise
is clearly related to digestion. When the
digestion process is disturbed, air or gas may accumulate
in the stomach or bowels and give rise to
colic or hoven. A watery action of the intestines,
due to inflammation or irritation, may lead to
dysentery and enteritis; or some obstruction like a
hair-ball or a clover fuzzy ball, or the knotting of
the intestines, may occur, temporarily or permanently
impairing digestion so seriously often as to
cause death itself.</p>

<h3>CIRCULATION</h3>

<p>As water in the plant is the carrier of plant food
throughout the plant, so is blood the carrier and
distributor of food in the animal. When food is
absorbed, it either passes into the lymphatic system
or into the capillaries of the blood system.<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
If in the former, it is carried to the thoracic duct,
which extends along the spinal column and enters
one of the main blood vessels. If collected by the
capillary system, it is carried to the portable vein,
thence to the liver and finally to the heart, where
it meets with the blue blood collected from all parts
of the body.</p>

<p>At this point, the blood contains both the nutriment
and the waste matter of the body. Before it
can be sent through the body again the waste material
must be thrown out of the system by means
of the lungs. This is accomplished by the heart
forcing to the lungs the impure blood with its impurities
collected from all parts of the body and
also the nutriment collected from the digestive
tract.</p>

<p>The chief organs, therefore, of the circulatory
system are the blood and lymphatic vessels containing
respectively blood and lymph. The only difference
between these two materials is in the fact
that lymph is blood without the red-blood corpuscles.
The body, after all, really depends upon this lymph
for nourishment, since it wanders to all parts of
the body, surrounds all the cells in all of the tissues
and in this way carries to the cells the very kinds of
food that they need.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Lymph Passes Through Cell Walls.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The blood
vessels have no openings into the body at all. In
this respect the blood system is like the digestive
system; it is separate and distinct in itself. The
blood, however, does creep through the walls of the
blood vessels. In so doing the blood corpuscles
are left behind and lymph is the result.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600p" id="Fig11">
<img src="images/illo030.png" alt="" width="600" height="327" />
<p class="caption main">HOW THE BLOOD CIRCULATES THROUGH THE BODY</p>
</div>

<p>The center of the blood system is the heart. It
is the engine of the body. Going out from it is the
great aorta, which subdivides into arteries and<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]<br /><a id="Page31">[31]</a></span>
farther away further subdivides until there is a
great network of little arteries; these in turn become
very tiny and take the name of capillaries.
Thus the red blood, by means of arteries and capillaries,
is carried to all parts of the body. This
plan of distribution would not be complete unless
some way were provided for the return of the blood
to the heart and lungs for purification. And just
such an arrangement has been provided. Another
kind of network collects this scattered blood at the
extremities into separate vessels, which gradually
increase in size and finally empty their possessions
into the heart. These are the veins of the body,
and have to do with the impure blood of the body.</p>

<h4 class="inline">How the Heart Does Its Work.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The power back
of blood distribution is the heart. It is an automatic
pump, as it were, that sends blood to the
lungs and through the arteries to all parts of the
body. The heart is divided into four divisions:
the left and right ventricles and the right and left
auricles. The right auricle receives the blood from
the upper half of the body through a large vein
and the lower half of the body through another
large vein, and the blood from both lungs empties
into the left auricle through two left and two right
pulmonary veins. The large arteries of the heart
which carry the blood from the heart to the different
organs arise from the ventricle.</p>

<p>The blood always flows in the same direction. It
goes into the auricle from the veins, and from this
into the ventricle. It then passes into the arteries,
then to the veins and then to the capillaries.</p>

<p>The action of the heart is very much like a force
pump; the dark blood flows into the right auricle,
which contracts; when this is done, the blood is<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
forced into the right ventricle; this in turn contracts
and forces the blood into the lungs, where
oxygen is taken on and carbonic acid gas and other
impurities are thrown off. From the lungs the
blood, now red and pure, passes into the left auricle
and thence into the left ventricle, from which it is
forced into the aorta to be distributed to all parts
of the body.</p>

<p>We now see the close connection existing between
the digestive system and the circulatory
system. The digested food in the intestines is
gathered in by villi cells. The question can now
be asked, What do these cells do with this nutriment
or digested food? They pour it into the
absorbent vessels or lymphs, as they are called;
these in turn empty the assimilated stores of food
into larger and still larger vessels, which continues
until the whole of the nutritive fluid is collected
into one great duct or tube, which pours its contents
into the large veins at the base of the neck,
from whence it is carried into the circulatory system,
the very basis of which is the blood.</p>

<h3>RESPIRATION</h3>

<p>The dark and impure blood, after returning to
the heart, is sent to the lungs. It is, when collected
from the body, just before being sent to the lungs
dark, dull and loaded with worn-out matter. It
must now be sent to the lungs, where it may be
spread over the delicate thin walls of millions of
vesicles, to be exposed to the air, which is inhaled
by the acts of breathing. The blood gives off the
broken-down material and carbonic acid gas very
readily. It is both unpleasant and disagreeable,
and the blood cells find it very unattractive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span></p>

<p>The cells of the blood, however, have a great attraction
for oxygen, consequently the cells absorb
oxygen with greediness, so that when the blood
returns to the heart it is fresh and bright and
ready to take its journey back over the body again.
This is done just about every three minutes. This
endless round continues until stopped forever by
death.</p>

<p>The relation existing between the animal and
plant functions is brought to light in another way.
When the plant was building tissue it released
oxygen and exhaled it into the air. At the same
time, by means of leaves, it gathered in the carbonic
acid to use in plant building. Of course this
was got from the air. The animal in performing
its functions and in building its tissue inhales oxygen
from and exhales carbonic acid gas into the air.
Thus it is that animals take up what is unnecessary
to the plant and the plant uses what is waste and
poison to the animal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="chapname">The Teeth As An Indication of Age</span></h2>

<p>When a colt is born the first and second temporary
molars, three on each jaw, are to be seen.
These are large when compared with the size of
those that later replace them. In from five to ten
days after birth the two central incisors or nippers
make their appearance. In three or four weeks the
third temporary molars appear, followed within a
couple of months by an additional incisor on each
side of the first two, both above and below. The
corner incisors appear between the ninth and
twelfth months after birth. This makes the full
set of teeth&mdash;twenty-four in number.</p>

<p>There is now no change in number, although there
is considerable change taking place all the time; the
incisor teeth, in rubbing against each other, are
more or less worn, giving rise to the expression
&#8220;losing the mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two molars present at birth remain until
the animal is about three years old, at which time
they fall out of their sockets by the protrusion of
the second set, or permanent molars.</p>

<p>This change from temporary to permanent teeth
takes place usually without difficulty and without
trouble. The permanent teeth push their way up
from below crowding those in view. While this
pushing and crowding is going on the temporary
teeth are losing ground, for the reason their roots
are being absorbed, and a time comes when the cap
only is left attached to the gums. This cap drops<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
out and the new or permanent tooth soon is established
in its place.</p>

<h3>LOSING OF TEMPORARY TEETH</h3>

<p>According to the observation of Mayo, the temporary
incisors are replaced by permanent teeth
as follows: &#8220;The two central incisors are shed at
about two and a half years, and the permanent ones
are up &#8216;in wear&#8217; at three years. The lateral incisors
are shed at three and a half and the permanent
ones are up and in wear at four years. The
corner incisors are shed at four and a half and the
permanent ones are up and in wear at five.</p>

<p>&#8220;The molars are erupted and replaced as follows:
The fourth molar on each jaw (which is
always a permanent molar) is erupted at ten to
twelve months; the fifth permanent molar at two
to two and a half years, and the sixth usually at four
and a half to five. The first and second molars,
which are temporary, are shed and replaced by permanent
ones at two to three years of age. The
third temporary molar is replaced by a permanent
one at three and a half years. In males, the canine
or bridle teeth are erupted at about four and a half
years of age. At about five years of age a horse is
said to have a full mouth of permanent teeth.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE MARK IN THE TOOTH</h3>

<p>Horsemen make use of the &#8220;mark in the tooth&#8221;
for determining the age between five and eleven.
In examining teeth you observe that two bands of
enamel are to be seen; one exterior, that surrounds
the tooth, the other interior, which is termed the
casing enamel. It is this latter, or &#8220;date cavity,&#8221;
that is used to tell the age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span></p>

<p>The mark in the tooth is occasioned by the food
blackening the hollow pit. This is formed on the
surface by the bending in of the enamel, which
passes over the surface of the teeth, and, by the
gradual wearing down of the enamel from friction,
and the consequent disappearance of it, the age can
be determined for a period of several years.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500p" id="Fig12">
<img src="images/illo036.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="273" />
<p class="caption main">LUMPY JAW</p>
<p class="caption subshort">The disease is caused by the ray fungus. The result is local
tumors in the bones and other tissues.</p>
</div>

<p>When a horse has attained his sixth year the
mark on the central or middle incisors or nippers
of the lower jaw will be completely worn off, leaving,
however, a little difference of color in the center
of the teeth. The cement which fills the hole
produced by the dipping in of the enamel will be
somewhat browner than that of the other portions
of the tooth, and will exhibit evident proofs of the
edge being surrounded by enamel.</p>

<p>At seven years the marks in the four middle incisors
are worn out and are speedily disappearing
in the corner ones. These disappear entirely at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
age of eight; thus all marks are obliterated at this
age on the lower jaw; the surface of the teeth are
level and the form of the teeth changes to a more
oval form.</p>

<p>The marks on the upper jaw are still present,
since there has been less friction and wear on them.
At nine the marks disappear from the central upper
incisors, at ten from the adjoining two, and at
eleven from the corner teeth.</p>

<p>To tell the age of the horse beyond this period
is difficult and uncertain, except by those very
much experienced in performing the undertaking.
The shape of the teeth, the color and the condition
all enter into the determination but there is no
fast and fixed rules after the marks have disappeared.</p>

<h3>TEETH OF CATTLE</h3>

<p>Cattle have no incisor teeth on the upper jaw.
They have eight incisors on the lower jaw. According
to Mayo, the temporary incisors are as
follows: &#8220;The central incisors or nippers are up
at birth, the internal lateral at one week old, the
external lateral at two weeks, and the corner incisors
at three weeks old. They are replaced by
permanent incisors approximately as follows,
though they vary much more than in the colt: The
central incisors are replaced at 12 to 18 months;
the internal laterals at about two and a half years;
the external laterals at three to three and a half
years; and the corner incisors at about three and
a half years. In the horned cattle, a ring makes
its appearance at three years of age, and a new ring
is added annually thereafter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span></p>

<h3>TEETH OF SHEEP</h3>

<p>Sheep, like cattle, have no incisor teeth on the
upper jaw. Like cattle, they have eight incisors
on the lower jaw when the mouth has reached full
age. The change of the teeth occurs as follows:
At birth the lamb has two incisors, followed by two
more very soon. At the end of two weeks two
more are out, making six incisors in all. At three
weeks of age two more have appeared, completing
the appearance of the temporary or milk teeth.</p>

<p>The permanent begin to replace the temporary
teeth between one and one and a half years. The
two central milk teeth are first replaced by two
longer and stronger teeth. The lamb is now known
as a yearling.</p>

<p>At two years the two teeth adjoining the central
incisors are replaced by permanent ones; at three
the two adjoining these are replaced, making now
six permanent incisors.</p>

<p>Between four and four and a half the last two
permanent incisors appear and the sheep then has
a full mouth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="chapname">Examining Animals for Soundness and Health</span></h2>

<p>In purchasing farm stock, it is a good plan to deal
with reputable people only. Leave the horse trader
alone. He knows too many tricks, and if you are a
stranger to him you can be pretty certain that he
will try one on you&mdash;just for fun.</p>

<p>Fortunately farmers sell to strangers more frequently
than they buy of them, and when they
seek new stock they deal largely with breeders,
who, like themselves, are farmers and not given
to the tricks of low and disreputable methods;
nevertheless, every purchaser of stock should be
familiar with animal form and able to recognize
defects and faults when he sees them. This is as
much his business as to breed, raise or feed the
stock on his farm.</p>

<h3>LOOKING THE ANIMAL OVER</h3>

<p>Know what form you want; draft and speed
represent different types, so do dairy and beef.
With all classes of farm stock there are a few
points that are desirable in all stock. One of these
is width between the eyes. No animal of any
breed or class possessed of a narrow forehead is
at all perfect. A wide forehead is one of the absolute
beauties.</p>

<p>These are desirable characters of all farm
animals; they represent culture and refinement
and good breeding. The purchaser or breeder,
therefore, should not only know conformation, but
he should know quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span></p>

<h3>SPECIAL TYPE IN HORSES</h3>

<p>Our breeds of horses may be divided into three
general classes. Those used for speed, those for
draft and those with a mixture of the two&mdash;a general
purpose sort of horse. The speed or trotting
horse has its distinct type; it has been evolving
and developing through a long series of years.</p>

<p>Briefly, its conformation may be described as
follows: A wide forehead, fairly long head, a long
neck that is thin and agile, a narrow chest as you
look at it from the front, but very deep as you look
from the side, long sloping shoulders, rather long
back, a long horizontal croup, small barrel, fairly
long forearm, long cannon bones and feet that are
well shaped and perfect in every respect. Looking
at the animal from the side it should be as high over
the hips or higher than over the withers.</p>

<p>The draft horse, on the other hand, has a different
conformation. There is not that elongation
of his parts, although there is a symmetry of parts
and of proportion. There should be the width
between the eyes; the clean, neat face; a graceful
neck, which should be shorter and more heavily
muscled than that of the speed horse. The chest
should be wide, both from the front and side, the
back short but heavily muscled, the croup strong
and not so horizontal as with the speed type, the
quarters heavily muscled and the cannon bone
short.</p>

<p>The feet should be as perfect as those of the
speed horse. In both types the knee should be
thick, deep, and broad and the hocks wide. The
narrow hock is not so well able to stand heavy
strain, consequently curb diseases readily follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
where the conformation shows narrow hocks. Another
difference between the two types is found in
the muscles. The speed type throughout has long,
thin, narrow muscles&mdash;muscles that stretch a long
way and contract quickly.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450p" id="Fig13">
<img src="images/illo041.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="318" />
<p class="caption main">BAD ATTITUDES DUE TO CONFORMATION</p>
<p class="caption sublong">In the first, the toes are turned out. The middle picture
shows in-kneed attitude and the third shows in-turned toes.
Whether standing or traveling, the appearance is unpleasant
and mitigates against the value of the animals.</p>
</div>

<p>With the draft horse it is different: the muscles
are shorter, but they are heavy; they are less quick
in their action, but they are more powerful. In
both types good proportions are always desirable.
The width between the eyes should be as much or
more than one-third the length of the head. The
distance from the point over the shoulders to the
ground should be about equal to the distance from
the point over the hips to the ground; and in turn
this distance, whatever it is, should be about equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
to the length of the horse from the point of the
shoulder to the point of the buttock.</p>

<p>Looking at the horse in front if a line be dropped
from the point of the shoulder it should halve the
fore leg, the knee, the cannon, and the hoof. And
the width of the third hoof, if placed between the
two front feet, should give the attitude that is
desirable.</p>

<p>Looking at the horse from the rear, the same
attitude is to be observed. Of course, many horses
do not possess these qualities and proportions; and
because they do not is the very reason that their
beauty, efficiency, and value are less.</p>

<h3>EXAMINING ANIMALS IN THE STABLE</h3>

<p>In going into the stable look the animals over
quietly. Observe how they stand, breathe, eat, and
act generally. Are they nervous? Does one swing
his head from side to side? Does he kick, paw,
put back his ears, or does he have any of the other
common stable vices that are unpleasant and undesirable?
As you look about and pass back and
forth, you will get the evidence of these stable
vices, if such are to be found.</p>

<p>Look particularly for cribbing, wind sucking,
kicking and crowding. Pawing is just as bad. If
you want animals with good stable manners pass
by those possessing these ugly faults. The next
step is to examine the animals individually; those
that &#8220;look good&#8221; to you. No doubt you will find
some that do not interest you for one reason or
another. These need no further attention, unless
you have overlooked some fact, in which case your
attention will likely be called to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span></p>

<p>In making the individual examination, go up to
the animal in the stall, place your hand on the hip,
and gently press it. If no stringhalt afflicts the
horse, he will move over, allowing you to pass into
the stall. The same applies to the cow. If well
trained, she will make room for you by moving
over at the same time, if you do this on the proper
side, and she will put back her hind foot, as if she
were about to be milked.</p>

<p>This casual observation would not be possible
if force were used or the animal excited by loud
commands or by a whip or strap. The halter
teaches its lesson also. A heavy rope or leather
suggests that the animal has a pulling back vice,
a habit you want to avoid. Light halters for horses
and cattle are to be preferred to chains, heavy
leather, or ropes.</p>

<h3>REAL TEST IS OUT OF DOORS</h3>

<p>Now that you have seen all of the animals for
sale, ask the owner to lead them out of doors for
a more careful examination. In this you will
inspect the animal very carefully in order to be
certain of the conformation, defects, and blemishes,
and to acquaint yourself specifically as to health
and disposition.</p>

<p>Cast your eyes over the animal, front, side, and
rear. Pass around the animal, keeping some distance
away. By so doing you can judge of type
and conformation, of proportions and attitudes; for
each of these is important. A beefy-looking cow, with
a thick neck, square body and small udder will not
suit you for milk. Neither will a cow with a long,
thin neck, open, angular body, thin thighs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
heavy, deep paunch meet your needs if you are
seeking breeding stock for beef production.</p>

<p>If you are examining a horse, keep in mind the
purpose for which you are selecting. Remember
the long, thin neck, very oblique shoulder, long
cannon, long back, and long thin muscles are not
adequate for draft. On the other hand, if you want
a horse for road purposes, avoid the heavy muscles,
the short neck, the heavy croup, and the heavy
thighs. These mean draft&mdash;an animal for heavy
work.</p>

<h3>SPECIAL TYPE IN CATTLE</h3>

<p>The milk cow should have a very soft, mellow
skin, and fine, silky hair. The head should be narrow
and long, with great width between the eyes. This
last-mentioned characteristic is an indication of
great nervous force, an important quality for the
heavy milker. The neck of the good dairy cow is
long and thin, the shoulders thin and lithe and
narrow at the top. The back is open, thin, and
tapering toward the tail. The hips are wide apart
and covered with little meat.</p>

<p>The good cow is also thin in the regions of the
thigh and flank, but very deep through the stomach
girth, made so by long open ribs. The udder is
large, attached well forward on the abdomen, and
high behind. It should be full, but not fleshy.
The lacteal or milk veins ought also to be large and
extend considerably toward the front legs.</p>

<p>The beef cow is altogether different: she is
square in shape, full and broad over the back and
loins, and possesses depth and quality, especially
in these regions. The hips are even with flesh, the
legs full and thick, the under line parallel with<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
the straight back. The neck is full and short, the
eyes bright, the face short, the bones of fine texture,
the skin soft and pliable, and the flesh mellow,
elastic, and rich in quality.</p>

<p>In other words, a beef cow is square and blocky,
while the dairy cow is wedge-shaped and angular.
The one stores nutriment in her body; the other
gives it off. The one is a miser, and stores all that
she gets into her system; the other is a philanthropist
and gives away all that comes into her possession.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that the two types are
radically different. This difference is due to breeding,
not to feeding, nor to management. If you
are seeking good milk cows, you must look for
form and conformation. If you are looking for
beef cows, you must also look for form and conformation,
but of a different kind. With this
knowledge to back you up and to guide you, you
are now ready to make an examination of animals
that will meet your purpose.</p>

<h3>GOING OVER THE ANIMAL IN DETAIL</h3>

<p>After making these general observations you are
now ready to examine the animal. Begin with the
head. How is the eye? Dull, weak, without
animation? If so, be on your guard. The good
eye shows brightness, intelligence, and it must be
free from specks. By placing the hand over the
eye for a few moments you will be able to detect
its sensitiveness to light. Do you find any discharge
of any kind from the eye? If so, some inflammation
is present. Try to ascertain the cause.</p>

<h4 class="inline">The Nostril As An Index.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A large, open nostril
is desirable. Look for that character first. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
observe the color of the lining. To be just right, it
should be healthy-looking, of a bright rose-pink
color, and it should be moist. A healthy nostril is
one free from sores, ulcers, pimples, and any unpleasant
odor. Be careful here; an unscrupulous
dealer can very easily remove discharges and odors
by sponging and washing, and you may be deceived.</p>

<p class="caption main">EWE NECK</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The neck is one of the beauty points of the horse. In
purchasing animals look carefully to conformation and quality.
Let these also be guiding principles in breeding.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="inline">Looking In the Mouth.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Always look in the
mouth; you have the tongue, teeth, jaws, and
glands to see. Naturally, you, like every other
person, consider the teeth first; you want to be
certain of the age. This feature is discussed elsewhere
in this book, and all in addition that needs
to be said is in reference to the shape of the teeth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
whether or not they are diseased or worn away
by age or by constant cribbing of the manger. Of
course these facts you will think of as you examine
the mouth.</p>

<p>Give the tongue a second of your time. If it is
scarred and shows rough treatment a harsh bit is
likely the cause, due to its need in driving and
handling.</p>

<p>Then give a thought to the glands while here.
Enlarged glands may indicate some scrofulous or
glanderous condition of the system.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Neck and Throat.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A beautiful neck and throat
is an absolute beauty in the horse or cow. The
skin should be thin, mellow, and soft, and the hair
not over thick nor coarse. Look for poll-evil at
the top of the neck and head. See if swellings,
lumps or hard places are to be found at the sides
of the neck, or underneath joining the throat. I
have found such very frequent with dairy cattle;
and cases are not unusual with horses.</p>

<p>Frequently scars are to be found on the sides or
bottom of the neck. These may be due to
scratches caused by nails, barb-wire or some similar
accident, and again they may have been caused
by sores, tumors, or other bad quality of the blood.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Body and Back.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Passing the side, look over the
withers for galls or fistul&aelig;, the shoulders for
tumors, collar puffs, and swellings. Observe at
the same time if there is any wasting of the muscles
on the outside along the shoulder.</p>

<p>Now the back. Is it right as to shape? Do you
find any evidence of sores or tumors? Look for
these along the sides and belly. Now stoop a bit
and look under; do you find anything different
from what is natural? In males look for tumor or
disease of the penis; do the same with the scrotum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
and, in case of geldings scrutinize carefully to see
if they be ridgelings.</p>

<p>While making this examination, if the animal is
nervous and fretful, you can help matters along if
an assistant holds up a fore leg. Take the same
precaution when examining the hind quarters and
legs. By doing so, you will avoid being kicked and
can run over the parts more quickly and satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Before leaving the body observe if the hips are
equally developed, and the animal evenly balanced
in this region. Both horses and cattle are liable to
hip injury, one of the hips being frequently knocked
down. Make sure that both are sound and natural.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Fore Legs and Front Feet.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Now step to the
front again for a careful examination of the front
legs and feet. Starting with the elbow, examine
for capped elbow; now the knee. It should be
wide, long, and deep, and at the same time free
from any bony enlargements. The knees must
stand strong, too. Is the leg straight? Do you
observe any tendency of the knee to lean forward
out of line, showing or indicating a &#8220;knee sprung&#8221;
condition? Just below the knee, do you find any
cuts or bunches or scars due to interference of the
other foot in travel? Look here also for splints;
follow along with the fingers to see if splints are
present&mdash;on the inside of the leg.</p>

<p>Be particular about the cannon. The front should
be smooth&mdash;you want no bunches or scars. Just
above the fetlock feel for wind puffs; and note if
about the fetlock and pastern joints there are any
indications of either ringbones, bunches, or puffs.
Now look for side bones; if present, you will find
them just at the top of the hoof. They may be on
either side. Sidebones are objectionable, and are<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
the lateral cartilages changed into a bony structure.</p>

<div class="figleft w200p" id="Fig15">

<p class="caption main">ANATOMY OF THE FOOT</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The delicate nature of
the foot is readily recognized
when the various
parts are considered in their
relation to each other.</p>
</div>

<p>Give the foot considerable attention. The old
law of the ancients, &#8220;no feet, no horse,&#8221; is certainly
true in our day. You can overlook many
other imperfections and
troubles in the horse, but
if the feet are bad you do
not have much of a horse.
A good foot is well
shaped, with a healthy-looking
hoof and no indication
of disease either
now or ever before.</p>

<p>See that the shape is
agreeable. A concave wall
is not to be desired, and
the heels are not to be contracted.
The wall should
be perfect&mdash;no sand cracks,
quarter crack, or softening
of the wall at the toe of
the foot.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Examine for Corns.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These
are both troublesome
and cause much
lameness. A healthy frog,
uninjured by the knife or
the blacksmith or other
cause is very much to be
preferred.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Hind Legs and Feet.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;In examining these
regions give the hocks of the horse special attention.
No defect is more serious than bone spavin.
You can, as a rule, detect this by standing in front
of the horse just a little to the side. If there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
any question about the matter, step around to the
other side and view the opposite leg. This comparison
will let you out of the difficulty, as it is
very unusual that this defect should be upon both
legs at the same point and developed to the same
degree.</p>

<p>A spavin is undesirable for the reason that it
often produces serious lameness, which frequently
is permanent. As it is a bone enlargement, it is
something that cannot be remedied. If you are
seeking good horses, better reject such as have
any spavin defect.</p>

<p>In this same region between the hock and the fetlock
curbs troubles are located. They appear at
the lower part of the hock, directly behind. You
can readily detect any enlargement if you will step
back five or six feet. The curb, while it may not
produce lameness, is altogether undesirable. It
looks bad; it shows a weakness in the hock region
and often is caused by overwork, consequently the
animal with curb disease is one that has not measured
up to the work demanded of him.</p>

<p>Just above and to the rear of the hock the
thorough-pin disease appears, and just in front of
and slightly toward the inner side of the hock bog
spavin is sometimes to be found. Lameness may
come from either of these diseases. Small tumors,
puffs and other defects frequently show themselves
on the hind legs and the best way is to reject
animals having them. While some of these may
be caused by accident, the most of them are the
result of bad conformation, due to heredity, unimproved
blood and bad ancestors.</p>

<h3>EXAMINING FOR LAMENESS</h3>

<p>Lameness comes from many causes; maybe from<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
soreness, from disease or from wounds. And
lameness is hard to detect. Frequently it seems
to be in the shoulder, when in fact it is a puncture
in the foot. Again it may seem to be in the fetlock,
but the trouble is in the shoulder or fore leg.
You must examine for lameness both in the stable
and out of the stable. If you find the horse standing
squarely upon three feet and resting the fourth
foot, you should be suspicious. If you move the
horse about and he assumes the same attitude again
and still again, you can be certain that he is assuming
that position because he wants to rest
some part of that member.</p>

<p>In testing out the horse for lameness, let no excitement
prevail. Under such excitement the horse
forgets his lameness or soreness for the time being,
and you do not note the trouble. A quiet, slow
walk or trot on as hard a road as possible is a
desirable sort of examination to give.</p>

<h3>TESTING THE WIND</h3>

<p>The free breathing of a horse may be interfered
with, and for two reasons. Roaring or whistling,
as it is called, is a serious disease of the throat, and,
at the same time, an incurable disease. The second
disease is known as heaves or bellows, and is also
a most serious disease, because it is also incurable.
By the use of drugs relief may be given temporarily,
but no permanent cure follows. Unscrupulous
dealers will resort to dosing for the time being, or
until a sale is made.</p>

<p>You should guard against this trouble, however,
for it is one of the most serious that a horse can
have. Upon this subject, Butler has the following
to say: &#8220;To test the wind and look for two serious
conditions and others which may be present,<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
the animal should be made to run at the top of his
speed for some considerable distance&mdash;a couple
hundred yards or more. Practically this run or
gallop should be up hill, which will make the test
all the better. After giving the horse this gallop,
stop him suddenly, step closely up to him and listen
to any unusual noise, indicating obstruction
of the air passages, and also observe the movements
of the flanks for any evidence of the big double
jerky expulsion of the air from the lungs characteristic
of heavers.&#8221;</p>

<h3>TESTING OF THE PACES</h3>

<p>No examination is complete that does not make
a test of the paces. You want to know how fast
the horse can walk, how he trots or paces or how
he takes some other gait. Some horses make these
movements very gracefully; others very unmannerly.
A well-acting horse is one that moves
smoothly, regularly, who picks up his feet actively
and who places them firmly in their position regardless
of the ground or gait. Some horses have
a rolling movement of the legs. Avoid these.
Others step on the toe or heel. These, too, should
be avoided. They suggest some defect or bad conformation.</p>

<p>The testing of the paces brings all parts of the
body into play and assists in catching other blemishes
or defects that you may have overlooked in
your previous examination. It gives you another
opportunity to examine the wind, to observe the
respiration, the heart beatings, the condition of the
nostril after work; it shows you also how the
animal takes his pace and how he stands. All of
this will be of value as indicating the soundness
and health of the individual under observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span></p>

<h3>CONSIDERING FOR A SPECIAL PURPOSE</h3>

<p>Now, as a last factor of your examination, consider
the uses to which the animal is put. If you
are looking for breeding animals be sure to know
that the udder is not injured. Of what use is a cow
with a bad udder? How often do we find a quarter
of the udder destroyed or a teat cut or so badly
mangled as to be of little use! Some udders are
dead, heavy, fleshy; some are diseased, lumpy; and
even though the animal is otherwise good you must
reject her.</p>

<p>If the udder is good, superior in many respects,
and shows great milk production, you can often
afford to overlook other defects, especially if the
result of accident.</p>

<p>In the case of horses, a disease or blemish due to
accident may be overlooked, if the work to which
the animal will be subjected does not interfere,
let us say, for breeding purposes. The horse has
good conformation, good quality, is healthy and
very superior, but unfortunately a leg was broken.
Shall she be rejected as a breeder? No heavy
work will be required of her&mdash;she is wanted for
colt raising. Take her; of course you will pay
less for her. This accident interferes in no way
with her value for breeding purposes. Many cases
of accidental injuries are similar to this example
among cattle and horses.</p>

<p>A good rule is to reject those having defects or
blemishes that interfere with functional activity or
the work to which you wish to put them. Then, as
breeders, reject all with constitutional defects, as
bad feet, narrow hocks, coarse disease-appearing
bones, and bad conformation and scrubby character.</p>

<p class="caption main">FRACTURES</p>
<p class="caption sublong">When a bone is broken into
two or more parts it is said
to be fractured. These may
be straight across, up and
down, or oblique. Ordinary
fractures are easily treated
by splints, but sometimes
fractures are so serious as
to destroy the value of the
animal.</p>
</div>

<p>The stockman has all sorts of wounds with which
to deal. He may guard his animals with the care
and caution of a mother
and still find constant
bother and worry to
face in the daily management
of his stock.
Today it may be a
wound caused by a nail
puncture in the foot; tomorrow
a cut occasioned
by a fence; and then almost
immediately another,
the result of a kick
or a hook; with patience
nearly exhausted, now
follow bruises of many
sorts and unexplainable
lacerations.</p>

<p>These troubles occur
on the best managed
farms. There is but one
thing to do: meet each
case as it occurs and lend
such assistance as you
can that nature may repair
the wrecked tissue
at the earliest possible
moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span></p>

<h3>THE KINDS OF WOUNDS</h3>

<p>Wounds fall into four classes: the clean-cut kind
made by something sharp; the torn or lacerated,
where ragged edges are left; the bruised, the result
of continued pressure or kicks or a knock; and
the punctured, like the entrance of a nail or splinter
or gunshot.</p>

<p>The latter class is the most difficult in treating,
for the reason of the greater penetration that may
likely occur. In the case of gunshot, the wound
may be on the surface, or it may extend entirely
through the region attacked, or even penetrate
some vital organ like the heart or the lungs or
bowels, and either immediately or within a few
days be the cause of death. Fortunately such
wounds are rare. The stockman may never have
to deal with them at all. There are punctured
wounds that are common, however; some, indeed,
frequently lead to death. A nail wound is the
most serious, perhaps. It is likely that more cases
of tetanus or lockjaw are due to nail punctures than
to all others combined.</p>

<p>After this class comes the lacerated kind. These
heal slowly; the tissue being torn and bruised is
repaired only through the sloughing off of the injured
and now superfluous parts. As a result, even
with the most attentive surgical help, the injured
part develops its exposed sore, ending finally completely
healed, but permanently marked. Bruises
may be equally bad, long delayed in healing and
very painful. Do you remember the stone bruises
of boyhood days? How long it required to develop!
And the pain! I shall feel mine for ages
to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span></p>

<p>The clean-cut wounds, if not too serious, are the
least difficult in treating.</p>

<h3>FIRST STEP IN TREATING</h3>

<p>The flow of blood is usually associated with
ordinary wounds; other than with some bruised and
punctured wounds this is always true. Frequently a
nail puncture gives off no blood or it is not noticed.
However, the blood is present, for, from the very
nature of the trouble, blood rushes to the seat, this
being nature&#8217;s way of repair. Your first step,
therefore, is to check the excessive blood flow.</p>

<div class="figleft w250p" id="Fig17">
<img src="images/illo057.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="439" />
<p class="caption main">BANDAGING A LEG</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The method of applying
the bandage is shown here.
The bandage may be wrapped
directly over the hair or
over cotton saturated with
an antiseptic and placed over
the wound.</p>
</div>

<p>If left to itself the blood might do it. Blood has
the trick of coagulating or clotting; and this in
time will check the flow. But you can assist in
forming the clot very simply by applying some
finely ground material that the blood may be held
on the spot. Absorbent cotton is the best material
to use. In case this is not available, use something
of like nature&mdash;something that is clean, not stored
up with germs. Tea is good, as is flour also. Cold
water acts favorably, and for the slight, ordinary
surface wounds water is usually sufficient. A few
drops of some antiseptic in the water, if available,
is always advisable, for the freshest water
carries its full quota of germs, some of which
may cause trouble. A tiny bit of alum powder
will be found both effective and not painful.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Cleansing the Wound.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;After the flow of blood
has been stopped, cleansing the wound is next in
order. All dirt should be carefully removed, the
injured flesh cleansed, the torn tissues brought together
and stitched, if need be, and antiseptics applied.
The water used in bathing the wounded
flesh should contain an antiseptic, that the germs<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
present may be destroyed and no live ones admitted
by water in cleansing the wound. Any good commercial
antiseptic will do; or the old common ones,
like corrosive sublimate, one part in a thousand
parts of water, or carbolic acid, a teaspoonful in a
quart of water. Some powdered antiseptic like
iodoform is very desirable
for dusting into the
wound.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Making the Bandage.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Unless
the wound is
of little consequence it
should be covered
and bandaged that no
foreign elements be admitted
and that some
pressure may be given
to keep the broken parts
together. To secure this
effect absorbent cotton,
slightly moistened with
the antiseptic, should be
laid on the wound, and
firmly fastened by strips
of clean cotton cloth.</p>

<p>By winding this bandage
around and about
the wound, dressed in
this careful way, the
wound will be protected, germs will be kept out and
nature, thus reinforced, will be enabled to make a
rapid recovery. Unless the bandage is disturbed in
some way there is no need of changing it under
twenty-four or thirty-six hours. If, for any reason,
the bandage is displaced, dress as before, and bandage
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline">Special Treatment.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;When a cut wound is deep
or large, stitching is sometimes required, that the
broken parts may be brought together for more
rapid healing. Nothing is better for this than a
coarse needle and heavy thread. Before stitching,
however, the wound should be bathed as previously
described. The needle and thread should be soaked
in the antiseptic, that no germs may be introduced
by means of them.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to make the stitches. Place
the needle about an eighth to a quarter of an inch
from the edge of the wound across to the opposite
side. Bring the two ends together and tie, leaving
the lips of the wound as close together as possible.
If more than a single stitch is necessary, proceed
in the same way, placing the second stitch about
three-quarters of an inch from the first one; continue
as with the first stitch if more are necessary.</p>

<p>In case a needle and thread are not available, pins
may be used in the emergency. Insert the pin
through the two edges and bring the lips together,
making them fast by a thread or cord carried from
one end to the other several times, alternating to
the right and left as presented by the figure eight.
Sometimes the wound enlarges and becomes feverish.
If such becomes very severe, remove the fastenings
and bathe the wound very gently, using a
mild antiseptic wash of tepid water in which carbolic
acid has been placed.</p>

<p class="caption main">HEALTH AND DISEASE</p>
<p class="caption subshort">In the upper picture the pigs are treating themselves.
Below are shown hogs which died during shipment to
market.</p>
</div>

<p>Avoid any breaking of the healing tissue and do
not have the washing solution too strong, else it
may injure the delicate tissue growth. A teaspoonful
of carbolic acid to a quart of water is strong
enough. With lacerated wounds the treatment is
very similar. If the wound goes bad and becomes
spongy add a tablespoonful of acetate of lead and<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
a tablespoonful of sulphate of zinc to the antiseptic
solution and apply twice daily.</p>

<p class="caption main">MAKING POST MORTEM EXAMINATIONS</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The upper right hand picture shows the intestines of a
healthy sheep. On the left nodule disease is discovered. The
bottom picture illustrates how a carcass may be opened for
the examination.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="inline">Nail Punctures.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These very frequently cause
trouble. You have no way of observing the wound
and your only way of judging is from the way the
animal walks or acts, and if the hoof is unduly
hot. Locating lameness in the stifle joint is a common
but inexcusable error, as the action resulting
from lameness in the two parts is entirely different.
The so-called gravel which is said to enter the sole
of the foot and then to work out at the heel is
usually the working out of the pus or the matter
resulting from a nail puncture or a bruise.</p>

<p>If an animal becomes suddenly and severely lame
and there be no evidence of any injury to any other
part of the leg, such as swelling, heat and pain
upon pressure, it is always well to look for puncture
in the foot. If the animal stands with the
lame foot extended and when walking places the
lame foot well forward and brings the well foot up
to it, the evidence of puncture is still stronger.</p>

<p>To examine the foot properly the shoe should be
removed. It is not sufficient to merely scrape the
bottom of the foot clean, for if the nail has pulled
out and the horn sprung back in position, all trace
of its entrance may have been obliterated. To examine
the foot properly, tap the hoof with a hammer
or knife and the exact spot may be definitely
located. If the injury is of a few days&#8217; standing,
additional heat in the hoof and, perhaps, slight
swelling of the coronet may also be present.</p>

<p>In treating such wounds, pare away only such
parts of the hoof as necessity requires and introduce
a bit of cotton cloth rolled as a string by
means of a probe of some kind. Both probe and
cotton must be treated with the antiseptic solution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
This solution should be a little stronger than for
flesh wounds. Make the solution by using a teaspoonful
of carbolic acid to only a pint of water.
After the cotton has been inserted a few times and
withdrawn, each time a fresh cord being used
and fully saturated, leave the last one in for a few
hours and then repeat the treatment. This should
be done three or four times each day.</p>

<p>The main point in the treatment of nail puncture
of the foot is to provide free exit to all matter
that may collect and keep the parts as clean as possible.
If this be done, the matter will not be compelled
to work out at the heels, and no separation
or loss of hoof will occur. Often a very severe
wound is made and the treatment acts slowly.</p>

<p>In case proud flesh accumulates, it should be
burned away by a hot iron. After this operation
has been performed, the cavity should be filled with
balsam of fir and cotton placed over it, a piece of
heavy leather fitted to the foot and held fast by the
replaced shoe. This will usually end the difficulty.
A veterinarian should be called in case the wound
is severe or goes bad as the treatment progresses.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Treating Bruises.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;In treating bruises a different
procedure is necessary. The broken tissue is concealed&mdash;beneath
the skin and usually under the surface
muscles. Bathing with water and acetate of
lead&mdash;a quart of water and two tablespoonfuls of
the acetate&mdash;will tend to lessen the inflammation. In
time you may have to open the swelling for the pus
to get out. After doing so, inject some wash for
cleansing, using one quart of water and a tablespoonful
of chloride of zinc.</p>

<p>If the swelling remains, apply twice each month
a salve made by using one teaspoonful of biniodide<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
of mercury and three tablespoonfuls of lard. Wash
occasionally, using the chloride of zinc solution.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Leg Wounds.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Cleanse the wound with a wash
composed of one tablespoonful of acetate of lead,
one tablespoonful of sulphate of zinc, four tablespoonfuls
of tincture of arnica and one quart of
water. Use this wash frequently, every hour or so,
during the first day. After that three or four applications
will be sufficient. The sore should be
kept lower than the skin during the healing process.
If it tends to crowd up, apply a tiny bit&mdash;as
much as you can place on a one-cent piece&mdash;of
bichloride of mercury. This will assist in getting
an even heal and the skin will grow over, leaving
no blemish or swelling.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Maggots in Wounds.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;If the wound has been
treated as suggested above there is no possibility of
any trouble from maggots. These come from a
lack of cleanliness and neglect. Of course, an
animal often gets a wound and the owner is not
aware of the mishap. Wounds, more or less infrequently
treated, those made as the result of castration,
occasionally get infected with maggots.</p>

<p>When, for any cause, maggots are present, they
must be got rid of at once. A good plan is to use
chloroform, either by spraying or by throwing it in
the wound in small drops from a sponge.</p>

<p>The danger from maggots can usually be
avoided if a mixture composed of one tablespoonful
of turpentine, three tablespoonfuls of tar and two
tablespoonfuls of lard or fish oil be smeared all
around the border of the wound.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="chapname">Making a Post Mortem Examination</span></h2>

<p>Even on the best-managed stock farms some
animals do get sick and die. Good care and good
nursing may be given, but the sick animal frequently
does not recover&mdash;death often follows very
quickly, before you have an opportunity to observe
the development of the disease or to secure the
services of a veterinarian. Then, again, after a
lingering sickness an animal dies, the disease being
known or unknown as the case may be.</p>

<p>In any event, a post-mortem examination is
usually desirable, if for no other reason than that it
serves to familiarize you with the organs of the
body. With a little experience you can become
quite proficient in examining a dead animal, and
you can soon learn the difference between healthy
and unhealthy organs, between diseased and
normal tissues and the relation of the internal parts
to the whole body. A post-mortem examination
thus enables you to know the cause of the disease&mdash;where
it is located or whether death is the result
of accident or of some fatal disturbance of the
system.</p>

<p>This examination should be made as soon after
death as possible; the longer the delay the greater
the changes due to decomposition of the body and
its decay back to the original elements from which it
has come. Soon after death the stiffening process
takes place. This is known as rigor mortis. It
may occur within an hour after death and again it
may not be complete until twenty-five or thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
hours have passed. Soon after the death stiffening
has occurred the tissues soften and decomposition
rapidly follows.</p>

<h3>FIRST THINGS TO DO</h3>

<p>In making a post-mortem examination, in case
the animal has not been moved, the position of the
body is to be observed. Look all about you. Is
there any evidence of a struggle? Does either the
body or the ground appear as if spasms have taken
place? It may be a case of poisoning. If such be
true, the outward appearance may be further substantiated
by the internal condition. If inflammation
and irritation of the stomach and bowels are
observed, this evidence helps to confirm the first
observation.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400p" id="Fig18">
<img src="images/illo063.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="381" />
<p class="caption main">RICKETS IN PIGS</p>
<p class="caption sublong">Rickets in pigs is due, as in man and other animals, to an
improper development of the bone, the result of insufficient
mineral matter in the food. The bones are weak and bend
or break. It frequently appears after the pigs are weaned.
An abundant supply of wood ashes, charcoal, lime and salt is
always good for hogs.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span></p>

<p>The appearance of the struggle, however, is not
enough to establish a case of poisoning; for struggling
is a death characteristic of many diseases. Of
course, in making this preliminary examination you
will note if death could have been the result of some
other reason. Has some obstruction had anything
to do with the trouble? Maybe the animal has
been caught in some way and not being able to
move about has starved to death, or maybe some
over-exertion has had something to do with the
trouble.</p>

<p>Many animals choke, and, not being able to
relieve themselves, die. Thousands of farm
animals, especially in the West and Southwest, die
annually from cold, and not a few from heat. All
these things enter into the case and must be considered
in reaching a reasonable conclusion.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Observe the Discharges.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The next thing to do
is to observe the discharges from nose, mouth and
other natural openings of the body. External scars
and wounds often bear a close relation to the disease
and these should be considered in examining
the carcass. How do the eyes look? Is there a
discharge from the ears? Is the swelling of the
abdomen and the bloating more pronounced or different
than should be the case in ordinary death?
Practice will indicate the lesson that each of these
teach.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Accidents and Injury.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Farm animals are often
killed by stray shots from the guns of hunters and
trespassers. A casual observation will indicate if
death has been due to this. Again, animals may
die from distemper or be eaten up with lice or
troubled with itch or mange&mdash;you will note these
facts as you go along with your work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span></p>

<p>In the South, where Texas fever is so prevalent,
you should look for ticks, as these bring death to
thousands of animals each year. Look for the wee
tiny ones&mdash;they cause the trouble. When cattle
are fairly covered with the large ticks death does
not ordinarily follow, since the animal has practically
become immune to the poison caused by the
tick. These large ticks, however, are filled with
blood and nutriment, both obtained from the animal,
and hence they may rob the animal of blood and
nutriment that it ought to have itself.</p>

<h4 class="inline">After Removing the Skin.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The skin is now to be
removed, so that the color of the tissues and the
nature of the blood may be noted. If the blood be
thin or black, with a disagreeable odor, you can
expect some germ trouble like blood poisoning or
an infectious and contagious disease. If the white
tissues are yellow you may be reasonably certain
that the liver has not done its work as it would
have done had it been in a thoroughly healthy
condition.</p>

<p>In removing the skin and making other observations
be cautious that you do not prick your fingers
with the knife, since you may convey in this way
disease to yourself. If by accident a cut or prick
is made, cauterize the wound at once, so as to
destroy any germs transmitted in this way to you.</p>

<h3>EXAMINING THE INTERNAL ORGANS</h3>

<p>The next step is to examine the internal organs.
To do this, place the animal on its side, remove the
upper front leg and the ribs over the chest region.
The ribs should be removed as near as possible to
the backbone so as to give an unobstructed opening
over the important organs. This large opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
now allows you free access for examination, and
an unimpaired view all about the vital organs, if
these are entirely exposed.</p>

<div class="figcenter w550p" id="Fig19">
<img src="images/illo066.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="289" />
<p class="caption main">ROUND WORMS IN HOG INTESTINE</p>
<p class="caption sublong">An infestation with intestinal worms, as shown here, leads
to unthriftiness and a loss of flesh. These worms may be
expelled by giving turpentine in doses of one teaspoonful in
milk for three days in succession.</p>
</div>

<p>While making this opening, observe the watery
fluid as it escapes. If a large quantity is present,
dropsy or a rupture of the bladder is indicated. If
the trouble is due to the latter, an odor in the urine
will be quickly noted. When the fluid is red in
color, it indicates the presence of blood or some
inflammation of the abdomen or the bowels. A
large amount of watery fluid in the chest cavity is
an indication of some lung trouble; this is further
indicated by the tiny attachments running between
the lungs and the chest wall.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Stomach and Intestines.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;If the stomach and intestines
be abnormally red, congestion is indicated,
and if they be quite dark, even purple in color, you
may be sure that some kind of inflammation has<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
been the trouble. You will note also if the stomach
is hard and compacted; and, if so, indigestion may
have been the trouble. The intestines will also
show if they be hard and compacted or in any
otherwise bad condition. Pass the hands along to
see if the intestines are knotted in any place or if
nails are present in the stomach. It is not likely
that the nails have been the direct cause of death,
but this fact helps to indicate the condition of the
digestion trap.</p>

<p>Often hair balls or parasites will be found; either
may clog up the channel and may be the immediate
cause of death. I have on more than one occasion
found that the fuzz of crimson clover, accumulating
in the intestines of horses, rolls up into a hard,
compacted ball, and not being able to pass out, becomes
an obstruction in the passageway and
ultimately causes death.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Kidneys and Bladder.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The urine tells its tale
also; a very disagreeable odor indicates some disturbance;
and a brownish or dark-red color may
indicate a local disease or a constitutional breakdown.
Texas fever in cattle produces a very dark
or reddish urine, Azoturia in horses, a similar color.
Gallstones or gravel are often found in the bladder,
and these frequently cause serious disturbance, if
not death.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Lungs.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Look the lungs over carefully. See if
the natural color is present and if the soft, spongy
constituency responds to the same kind of touch
as does the thoroughly healthy lung. In health
the lungs are a very light pink color. If inflammation
has been present this will be indicated by the
dark color and the hard density.</p>

<p>When the lung is cut apart with the knife further
observation should be made. A marble appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
indicates inflammation and hard lumps or
tubercles indicate tuberculosis. These tubercles,
when cut open, show pus and a cheeselike material,
yellow in color&mdash;a true indication of the disease.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Other Observations.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;You should feel the heart
to know if it is natural or not, or to see if any of
the valves are broken, or if some inflammation has
been back of the trouble. The sides of the open
cavity should be observed before leaving. Is it
spotted, speckled? Are pink spots seen about the
ribs? This is an indication of hog cholera, and in
itself may lead to a correct interpretation of the
disease.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="chapname">Common Medicines and Their Actions</span></h2>

<p>The common medicines used in treating farm
animals are named in the following list, together
with origin, action, use, and dose.</p>

<h3>ACONITE</h3>

<p>Tincture of aconite is derived from the root of a
plant. When used, the heart beats more slowly
and the blood pressure is decreased, making the
medicine desirable in cases of inflammation.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, from 10 to 30
drops, and sheep and hogs 5 to 10 drops.</p>

<h3>ALOES</h3>

<p>This is usually bought in a powder form. It is
brown in color and bitter in taste. Considerable
time transpires before action in the bowels takes
place. Allow at least 24 hours. It is a physic and
blood purifier.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses, 4 to 5 tablespoonfuls; cattle,
4 to 8 tablespoonfuls; sheep, 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls;
and pigs, 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls.</p>

<h3>ALUM</h3>

<p>This mineral salt is used in washes for sore
mouth and throat, and cleansing wounds. It may
be dusted into wounds in powder form, and is both
drying and healing.</p>

<p>Dose: Use a tablespoonful to a pint of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span></p>

<h3>ANISEED</h3>

<p>This preparation is made from dried berries and
ground. It stimulates digestion, sweetens the
stomach, and serves as a tonic and appetite maker.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, a tablespoonful,
and for sheep and pigs, a teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>ARNICA</h3>

<p>For wounds, sprains, and bruises, tincture of
arnica is both cooling and restful. It is made from
the dried flowers of a plant, and is for external use.
Apply three or four times daily.</p>

<h3>ARSENIC</h3>

<p>This medicine comes from the mineral kingdom
and is very powerful. In using better get it in
some standard medicinal form such as Fowler&#8217;s
Solution. It is used as a tonic when the stomach
is bad and the system run down.</p>

<p>Dose: Fowler&#8217;s Solution; for horses and cattle,
2 tablespoonfuls; sheep, 1 teaspoonful; pigs, one-half
teaspoonful. In giving to stock mix with 4
tablespoonfuls of whiskey, and either use as a
drench or add to mash or gruel.</p>

<h3>BELLADONNA</h3>

<p>This is a tincture made from a plant. When
used it soothes, softens, and relaxes the parts to
which applied. It checks inflammation and relieves
pain, but must be carefully used.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 teaspoonful;
sheep, 10 drops; pigs, 5 drops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span></p>

<h3>BUTTER OF ANTIMONY</h3>

<p>This preparation, taken from a mineral, is not
used internally. It is a powerful caustic. Its principal
use is for curing thrush in horses&#8217; feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400p" id="Fig20">
<img src="images/illo071.png" alt="" width="400" height="399" />
<p class="caption main">TETANUS BACILLI</p>
<p class="caption subshort">How the germs look under the microscope. The poison produced
by them is one of the most violent known in disease.</p>
</div>

<h3>BROMIDE OF POTASSIUM</h3>

<p>This comes as a white crystal or powder, and is
used to quiet the nerves when some trouble like
lockjaw has set in.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 teaspoonful;
sheep and hogs, one-half teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>BINIODIDE OF MERCURY</h3>

<p>This bright red powder is used chiefly for blistering
purposes. It is excellent when a spavin or<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
splint or ringbone is just beginning. In preparing,
use one part of the mercury to nine parts of vaseline
or lard. Remember, it is a poison, and must
be carefully handled, as is true of some other preparations
of mercury.</p>

<h3>CAMPHOR</h3>

<p>The camphor of commerce is in the form of a gum
obtained from a tree by boiling and evaporation.
It is used in mixtures for coughs, sore throat, and
heaves. It is good also for colic and diarrh&#339;a and
assists in lessening pain. It should be given in
water.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses, 2 to 4 teaspoonfuls; cattle,
4 to 5 teaspoonfuls; pigs and sheep, 2 teaspoonfuls.</p>

<h3>CANTHARIDES OR SPANISH FLY</h3>

<p>This is in the form of powder, and is an irritant.
For use it should be thoroughly mixed with lard or
vaseline. One teaspoonful of the cantharides to 4
tablespoonfuls of lard or vaseline. When so prepared
it is excellent as a blister. It can be applied
for sweat thickenings or lumps on any part of the
body that is not on the bone. It should not be
used on curbs or tumors and is not used internally.</p>

<h3>CARBOLIC ACID</h3>

<p>This is got from coal tar and petroleum. When
full strength and pure it is in the form of crystals,
but is generally bought as a liquid. It is a disinfectant
and an antiseptic, and while used internally for
some purposes, is largely used internally in washes
and solutions. Its principal use is in bathing<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
wounds and sores. Care should be taken not to
have a wash contain too much of the acid, as it
will burn the wound and stop the healing action.
It is a corroding poison taken internally. It should
be just strong enough to kill bacteria; say, 1 part
to 1,000 parts of water. A very good healing salve
is made when 5 drops of pure carbolic acid is used
to 4 tablespoonfuls of vaseline.</p>

<h3>CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE</h3>

<p>This is used externally as an antiseptic and disinfectant.
Dissolve 1 part to 100 parts of water.
It is a preparation of mercury, is poisonous, but
excellent for bathing wounds and open sores.</p>

<h3>CASTOR OIL</h3>

<p>This oil is pressed from castor beans. It is a
mild physic similar to raw linseed oil. It is not
used much for live stock.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 pint; for sheep,
one-quarter pint, and for pigs, 4 tablespoonfuls.</p>

<h3>CALOMEL</h3>

<p>This is a heavy white powder and a mineral. Its
principal action is as a physic, and it has a cleansing
effect on the liver. Hence it is used for all kinds
of liver troubles. When dusted in old sores, it is
splendid for healing and drying up.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses, one-half to 1 teaspoonful;
cattle, 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls; sheep and pigs, one-eighth
teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>CROTON OIL</h3>

<p>This oil is made from seeds, and is one of the
most powerful physics known. It should never be<span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span>
used until milder physics do not respond. Use it
as a last resort.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses, 15 to 20 drops; cattle, 30 to
40 drops; sheep, 5 to 10 drops; and pigs, 2 to 3 drops.
In giving, it is best to use in connection with raw
linseed oil; of the linseed oil use 1 pint for horses
and cattle and one-quarter pint for sheep and pigs.</p>

<h3>CAUSTIC POTASH</h3>

<p>This chemical is most easily used when purchased
in pencil-like sticks. It is never given internally,
but is used to burn warts and growths by
wetting the stick and rubbing it over them. It is
also used for burning poisonous wounds to kill the
poison. It is commonly employed for dishorning
calves. When a week or ten days old, and the
button of the horn is just appearing, rub the potash
over the horn. This usually insures destruction of
the horn substance. Wet the stick of potash. See
that drippings do not run down the animal&#8217;s head.
In order to protect the fingers, when using, wrap
paper around the stick.</p>

<h3>CREOLIN</h3>

<p>This is the product of coal tar and comes in the
form of a thick, dark fluid, and, like tar, is harmless.
It is frequently used as the basis of salves for
wounds, scratches, and like troubles. It is a very
effective remedy for killing lice, ticks, or fleas, and
is used as a remedy when sheep are afflicted with
mange and scab.</p>

<p>Dose: Use from 2 to 4 tablespoonfuls to a pint
of water and shake well before using. Make up a
small quantity at a time, as creolin thus made loses<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
its value after exposure. For disinfecting purposes,
1 part of creolin to 100 parts of water is satisfactory.</p>

<h3>GENTIAN</h3>

<p>This is the root of a plant, dried and ground. It
is used principally as a tonic, and is very bitter;
commonly found in condition powders and is given
to animals that are weak and run down. If used
alone, give twice a day in the food and place on the
tongue with a spoon.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 tablespoonful;
for sheep, a teaspoonful; pigs, one-half teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>GINGER</h3>

<p>This is a dried root ground fine, secured from a
plant, and acts as a stimulant, relieving gases that
accumulate in the stomach. It is an excellent ingredient
to use in colic and indigestion preparations.
If given alone, doses may be repeated every
two or three hours.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 tablespoonful;
sheep, 1 small teaspoonful; pigs, one-half teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>HYPOSULPHITE OF SODA</h3>

<p>This salt is frequently used in combination with
gentian, equal parts of both, and in other recipes
for condition powder. It cleans the blood and
builds up the system after weakening diseases. A
common preparation is made by using one-half of
powdered gentian and one-half of hyposulphite of
soda. Mix all together and give two or three times
a day to the animal needing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span></p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 tablespoonful;
sheep, 1 teaspoonful; pigs, one-half teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>IODINE</h3>

<p>This dark brown tincture is not often used internally,
but is used as a sweat blister and for blistering
thickened glands. In using, take a feather,
painting the iodine on the lump until it blisters;
when the blister appears, grease the part; after two
or three days have passed, wash the lump with
warm water and soap and blister again.</p>

<h3>IODIDE OF POTASSIUM</h3>

<p>This white powder is obtained from the mineral
kingdom. When given internally it acts as an absorbent.
It is commonly used in cases of dropsy
of the belly. In administering, use equal parts of
ground gentian root and give twice a day.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle a teaspoonful; for
sheep and pigs, one-half teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>LINSEED OIL</h3>

<p>This oil is obtained from flaxseed, and is excellent
when a mild physic is desired. The easiest
and most effective way of giving to animals is in
the form of a drench. About 1 pint should be used
for horses and cattle. Raw linseed oil is usually
preferred to the boiled.</p>

<h3>LAUDANUM</h3>

<p>This is made from opium and is used both internally
and externally. It is commonly used<span class="pagenum" id="Page77">[77]</span>
where there is pain, hence it is excellent for relieving
pain and spasms and assists also in checking
inflammation.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 4 to 6 teaspoonfuls;
sheep and pigs, 2 to 4 teaspoonfuls.</p>

<h3>NUX VOMICA</h3>

<p>This powder comes from ground seeds, and is
used as a nerve stimulant. It is very efficacious for
strengthening weak, debilitated animals. A common
way is to mix equal parts of gentian and powdered
nux vomica thoroughly together. This may
be given as a drench, or in the feed or placed at
the back of the tongue with a spoon.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 teaspoonful three
times a day; for sheep and pigs, one-half teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>NITRATE OF SILVER</h3>

<p>This comes in the form of white penciled sticks.
It is excellent for burning off warts, proud flesh in
cuts and growths on any part of the body. Just
wet the stick and rub it on the parts. Of course,
be careful that your fingers are protected from the
chemical. It is a poison taken internally.</p>

<h3>NITRATE OF POTASH</h3>

<p>This is frequently called saltpeter, and comes as
a white crystal or powder. It is used for kidney,
lung and blood troubles. It has a very acute action
on the kidneys, causing them to secrete an extra
amount of urine.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 teaspoonful;
sheep and pigs, one-half teaspoonful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span></p>

<h3>SULPHATE OF COPPER</h3>

<p>This is commonly known as blue vitriol or bluestone.
It is excellent when given internally for
checking discharges, especially those of a chronic
catarrhal nature. It may also be used as a wash
for wounds, when a weak solution is made, and may
be dusted on the wound every day or two in case
proud flesh forms.</p>

<h3>SULPHATE OF IRON</h3>

<p>Green vitriol, or copperas, as it is commonly
known, is a splendid mineral tonic, and is commonly
used in combination with gentian, equal
parts of the two. Use when the system is badly
run down. It is also excellent as a worm powder.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 teaspoonful three
times a day; sheep and pigs, one-half teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>SUGAR OF LEAD</h3>

<p>This is frequently called acetate of lead. It is
seldom used internally, but quite generally externally
for healing washes, particularly for the eye.</p>

<h3>SWEET SPIRITS OF NITER</h3>

<p>This sweet-tasting and smelling preparation is
obtained from alcohol, and is in the form of a clear
liquid. It acts upon the kidneys and skin and is
commonly given in the drinking water of animals.
It is used in combination with other medicines for
colic and indigestion. It thus acts upon the bowels
and stomach and relieves pain and dissipates the
gases. In giving to animals mix in a pint of lukewarm
water and give as a drench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span></p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 2 to 4 tablespoonfuls;
for sheep and pigs, 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls.</p>

<h3>SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE</h3>

<p>This is the ordinary turpentine known by all. It
is excellent in cases of acute indigestion and colic,
and is destructive to bots and the long round
worms in horses. When used externally it is as a
liniment. When used internally a small quantity
is given with raw linseed oil.</p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 4 tablespoonfuls;
for sheep and pigs, 1 tablespoonful.</p>

<h3>SALTS</h3>

<p>The two common salts used for live stock are
Epsom and Glauber. Epsom salts are most frequently
used, the chief action being as a physic.
Aloes take the places of salts for horses, as it is
believed these are much better than the mineral
salts. In giving salts to cattle, the drench is most
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Dose: Use 1 quart of warm water in which
place 1 tablespoonful of ginger and 1 tablespoonful
of common soda. To this add 1 pint to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> pints of
salts and dissolve by shaking or stirring. For
sheep and pigs, one-quarter of this amount is sufficient.</p>

<h3>SULPHUR</h3>

<p>This yellow powder is well known and is a great
medicine when given internally. It acts on the
blood and purifies it. It is excellent also for killing
parasites or germs in the skin, hence it is good
for all diseases. When used internally it is best
to combine with gentian root. Give once a day for
a short period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span></p>

<p>Dose: For horses and cattle, 1 tablespoonful;
sheep and pigs, 1 teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>SOME COMMON PRESCRIPTIONS</h3>

<h4 class="inline">Colic Mixture.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Laudanum, 16 tablespoonfuls;
aromatic spirits of ammonia, 12 tablespoonfuls;
sulphuric ether, 2 tablespoonfuls; tincture of aconite,
10 drops; ginger, 16 tablespoonfuls. Dissolve
in a pint of water. From 10 to 20 tablespoonfuls
of this can be given in one-half pint of water. If
relief is not secured, repeat in a half hour, follow
with a third dose, then with another, giving the
doses one-half to one hour apart.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Fly Blister.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Powdered cantharides, 2 teaspoonfuls;
gum camphor powdered, 2 tablespoonfuls;
lard, 8 tablespoonfuls. After thoroughly mixing,
rub in 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the severity
of the blister desired.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Red Blister.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Gum camphor powdered, 2 tablespoonfuls;
biniodide of mercury, 2 teaspoonfuls;
lard, 8 tablespoonfuls. This should be rubbed in
from 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Cough Mixture.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Belladonna, 2 tablespoonfuls;
pulverized opium, 2 tablespoonfuls; gum camphor,
pulverized, 2 teaspoonfuls; chloride of ammonia, 2
tablespoonfuls; sulphur, 4 tablespoonfuls. An easy
way to give this is to mix with molasses and flour
until a paste is secured.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Soothing Ointment.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Laudanum, 8 tablespoonfuls;
aconite, 4 tablespoonfuls. This is excellent
for sprains, and relieves the pain and soreness when
applied to a part where there is much inflammation.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Hoof Ointment.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Raw linseed oil, one-quarter
pound; crude petroleum oil, one-quarter pound;
neat&#8217;s-foot oil, one-quarter pound; pine tar, one-quarter
pound. Mix well and apply every night<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
with a brush all over and under the hoof. A little
in the hair above will do no harm. Clean out the
hoof before applying.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Physic Drench for Horses.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Aloes, 8 teaspoonfuls;
common soda, 1 teaspoonful; ginger, 1 teaspoonful.
Dissolve these in a pint of lukewarm

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="chapname">The Meaning of Disease</span></h2>

<p>Any departure from a normal condition is disease.
The body, composed of different organs and
parts, is in a healthy state when each of these
performs its natural functions. Thus the normal
mind is concerned with normal mental acts; any
disturbances of the brain or spinal cords is immediately
manifested in the action of the animal;
likewise frequently a disturbance elsewhere may
later have its effect on the mental system.</p>

<p>Disease may result from some external cause
like from a wound, from food causing poison or
derangement of the digestive system, from water
introducing impurities, from parasites that disturb
normal functions, disorganize tissue or produce
toxines, or from other abnormal conditions&mdash;all of
which interfere with the normal functions of one
or more organs, regions, or parts.</p>

<p>In most cases the disturbances are readily recognized.
Swellings, bruises and wounds are located
at a glance. When blood passes from nose, ears
or intestines, a key to the trouble is at hand.
Coughs have their story. And vomiting, diarrh&#339;a,
convulsions, spasms, abnormal breathing or temperature
each indicates at what points an abnormal
condition is evident.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Disease, Both General and Local.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Some diseases
lead to disturbance throughout the entire body.
For instance, pus may accumulate at some point
from which it finds its way into the blood, in the
end reaching to other parts of the body that in time
also become affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span></p>

<p>Those diseases, with which fever is associated, are
general in nature. The nerve centers are influenced,
the body heat is increased and a weakened condition
prevails. Back of this are the disease poisons&mdash;chemical
poisons or germ poisons.</p>

<p>When the temperature of the body, as a result
of fever, rises too high certain life principles are
changed and death immediately follows. A temperature
of 106&deg; or 107&deg; is very high, and, therefore,
very dangerous. In treating disease the temperature
is watched, that the course of the fever
may be followed. Treating a fever, then, is helpful
and a natural part of the treatment of the disease
itself. The basis of the curative process rests upon
the principle of proper circulation and the excretion
of the impure substances.</p>

<h3>CAUSES OF DISEASE</h3>

<p>In the first place most diseases arise from mismanagement.
The very principles at the bottom
of good health receive no consideration and little
thought. On some farms it is seldom that a case
of disease is heard of; on others, stock are under
treatment at all times. Where order prevails,
where cleanliness is appreciated, where disease-producing
conditions are never allowed to accumulate
or even gain an introduction, health is the
rule and disease the exception. When the latter
appears, it is due to some outside influence that
gave it admission.</p>

<p>The greatest mischief in handling farm stock
comes from improper food, filthy or impure drinking
water, bad ventilation of stables, overwork, or
lack of exercise and poor sanitary conditions.</p>

<p>Disease, therefore, is largely due to causes within
control of the owner of the farm stock. True, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
source of trouble is due to mechanical causes:
horses get nail punctures, legs and necks and head
are cut in fences, blows bring bruises. But whose
fault? Certainly not the animal. Old boards with
nails ought not to be left in all sorts of places,
fences should be protected, and stable fixtures,
gates and harnesses should be in such order that
only in rare cases will injury result.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Disease from Chemical Causes.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Poisonous materials
and poisonous plants cause death to thousands
of animals annually. Of great importance to
the stock interests is the rapid destruction of these
harmful products. Fortunately in the older sections
these are about eliminated now, and we are
also understanding more about the molds that lead
to bad results when moldy forage is given as feed
to farm animals. In time disease will be considerably
lessened when only clean, wholesome food
finds its way into the mangers and feed racks&mdash;then
disease will depart and more rapid gains will
come.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Heredity Plays a Part.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Despite caution and
care, health is often disturbed because of hereditary
influences. Thanks to science, we know now that
many of the old bugbears of the past, and once so
entrenched, have become dislodged, and their true
import set right before the owner. Tuberculosis,
for instance, once so dreaded in both man and
beast, is now known not to be handed down from
parent to progeny; it is a germ disease, pure and
simple, and gets its start just as many other ailments&mdash;through
breath, or drink, or feed. There
are hereditary troubles, however, that continue
down through many generations. The narrow hock
of the horse invites curb diseases; the narrow
chest is a good breeding ground for tuberculosis<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
germs; straight pasterns are bad for the feet; poor
conformation is not consistent with efficiency or
easy functional activity.</p>

<p>These examples clearly show that form and type
and physical characteristics have roles to play in
animal economy and in health to which the wise
stockman will give heed.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="inline">Germs and Parasites.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;In addition to the above
causes of disease, another class is before us ready
to inflict its injury at all times. Indeed, it is
a class of the greatest importance. I refer now
to parasites, bacteria, and germs, which cause more
loss to live stock than all others combined. Think
of hog cholera, a germ disease; of tuberculosis, a
germ disease; of stomach worms, parasites; of staggers,
a mold disease; of abortion, a germ disease;
and hundreds of like nature, all due to parasites
and germs, disease agents that disturb and destroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
the delicate organs or exposed regions, as the case
may be, regardless of age, value, or breed.</p>

<p>Of course, remedies and treatment are being
worked out to meet these individual diseases as
they occur. Nevertheless, the best treatment is
prevention. It is far better to prevent than to
cure; and that is the line of action especially for
this class. Indeed, it is far easier to understand
the simple laws of prevention than the complicated
curative processes. Especially is this true since
germs are known and isolated, and their rapid destruction
with air, sunlight, and disinfectants
understood and available.</p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF DISEASE</h3>

<p>Enough has now been said to indicate that disease
originates as a reaction between the cause of
it and the body. Withhold food, and starvation&mdash;the
disease&mdash;follows. Withhold fresh air and oxygen,
and the tissue breaks down; disease results as
a reaction from the normal use of air and the demands
of the body for oxygen. Allow bacteria
admission to the body and settlement in the
tissues or organs most agreeable to each particular
one, and these will grow, multiply, and, unless
overcome by the natural resistance of the body,
will conquer and destroy, causing sooner or later
death and decay.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Immunity Sought by Inoculation.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Many diseases
that now yield to no curative treatment are
being met by inoculation. By this method the body
is reinforced by serum injections, that disease germs
and infections may be warded off, or in case of attack,
be so fortified against the disease germs as to
destroy them or render them inactive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline">Some Animals More Resistant to Disease.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An
infectious and contagious disease may affect a herd
or flock, destroying few or many. Some may never
be affected and yet be subjected to exposure and
contagion; such are immune and resist this particular
disease. Others may suffer a mild attack,
but throw it off with no disastrous consequence;
such are strong and their organs ably fortified
against any injurious inroad by the disease. On
the other hand the majority in a flock or herd is not
so able to throw off the disease for the reason of
being predisposed by nature to such attacks; their
very susceptibility invites attack, and if the infection
is intensely virulent the affected body will
most likely yield and death follow.</p>

<h3>THE COURSE OF DISEASE</h3>

<p>Each disease possesses its own peculiar characteristics,
which are more or less conspicuous in
each individual case. Then, too, some diseases develop
quickly and end quickly. Others run a course
of several weeks; and still others several months
or even years. The first class is acute, the second
chronic. In both kinds nature is at work endeavoring
always to effect a cure; and, unless other
complications arise, the result of improper food, bad
sanitary quarters, bad air, or conditions not conducive
to health, recovery will, in most cases, result.
The great drawback to rapid recovery comes from
the outside influences that counteract the curative
processes of the body itself. Good nursing, good
air, proper food, are back of rapid recovery.</p>

<p>Most diseases have been carefully studied, and
their course of development has been mapped out.
Our veterinarians know, in a general way, how fever<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
acts in live stock. If an animal is inoculated with
Texas fever germs, the veterinarian knows the
course of the disease beforehand. In a general way,
he knows when the fever will begin, how long it
will last, when it will be at its highest point, and
when it will disappear. He knows all of this, even
before he makes the inoculation. Yet no disease
invariably runs the same course in different individuals.
In fact, the virulence of bacteria have
much to do with the course; mild cases occur
usually when the germ is weak, and severe cases
when the germs are very virulent. This explains
why some attacks of measles or Texas fever or hog
cholera are more fatal than other attacks in other
places, or at other seasons of the year.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Typical Courses the Rule.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;It is in rare cases
only that a regular course is not followed by most
diseases. Take an infectious disease. The period
of incubation comes first; this follows up the infection.
During this period, no change in the
animal is observed. He seems well, acts well, and
does his work well. Nevertheless, all the time,
during this period of infection, the germs are developing,
multiplying, gaining headway, and so
entrenching themselves that illness and disorder
will soon follow. The period of infection varies
in different animals and in different diseases. It
may take two or three weeks for development, or
as few as two or three days.</p>

<p>Following the period of infection comes the
period of eruption. At this stage the typical characteristics
are observed. At the next step the disease
reaches its height with the animal under its
complete dominion. But only temporarily. If
properly nursed and treated, with most diseases,
the animal will pass through the period and recover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span></p>

<p>The final stage is the period of improvement.
The battle that has been waged between the body
and the disease is now about ended. The disease
germs have been routed and the body has been
victorious. All that now remains is the clearing
away of the d&eacute;bris. In this case it is scattered
throughout the body system. The damage that has
been done is to be repaired and left, if possible, as
near to the original condition, as the nature of the
disease will allow. The period of improvement will
vary in different diseases and in different animals.
Recovery may occur in a few days, in some cases,
and in others weeks and months will be required.
A change of feed or pasture or work is usually
necessary if the most rapid recovery would be had.
In some cases, nothing other than absolute rest will
suffice.</p>

<h3>THE TERMINATION OF DISEASES</h3>

<p>After the disease has run its course, the body
usually returns to its former normal condition.
There seems to be a limit to what the disease can
do. A healthy body may be attacked, but, in the
end, disease retires, having used itself up. There
are diseases, however, that leave their marks in
many ways. And these become permanent marks.
With many of these all of us are acquainted.
Smallpox is one. The pits over the face record the
fierce battle that was fought. The same is true
of wasted tissues, with scars that conspicuously
mark the track along which blood poison has traveled.
The shrunken hoof of the foundered horse
tells the adverse termination of that disease.</p>

<p>While recovery may be more or less complete,
the effect is to seriously injure the worth and value
of the individual. There is a long list of this kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w400p" id="Fig23">
<img src="images/illo090.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="443" />
<p class="caption main">RESULT OF BONE SPAVIN</p>
<p class="caption sublong">Pictured here is a natural hock free from disease and a
diseased hock, the result of bone spavin. The bone is seriously
affected and the easy action prevented.</p>
</div>

<p>Other diseases act differently in another way.
They progress slowly, are not noticeable at first,
but in the end are incurable. Take glanders as a
typical case. It quietly and silently develops, often
taking months or years in reaching the stage of
eruption or before it becomes apparent. During
all this time, and even after the disease is recognizable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
the animal goes on about his duties with
no apparent trouble. The disease, however, is
progressing all the time; in the end it conquers its
victim, the final stages are reached, and the animal
dies.</p>

<p>The stock raiser is concerned with different diseases
in so far as they mean slow or rapid recovery,
and particularly if they be contagious or not. His
entire herd will be impaired if glanders is introduced
into it. One tuberculosis cow will convey
the disease to all susceptible individuals in the herd
to which she belongs, especially if stabled in a tight
barn during the winter seasons when little or no
ventilation is intentionally provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="chapname">Diagnosis and Treatment of Disease</span></h2>

<p>Some diseases are not difficult to diagnose. Those
resulting from wounds or knocks are easily located,
and their treatment readily outlined. Others, however,
are not so easy. Something is observed as
wrong, the animal acts strangely, does not take to
its food, is fretful, stands or walks unnatural&mdash;what
is the matter? The stockman must ascertain the
trouble, and the quicker the better.</p>

<p>A review of the past few days is desirable. Where
has the animal been? What kind of food has it
had? With what strange fellows has it associated?
Has it been put to excessive work or exposed to
unusual weather or conditions? What infectious
diseases are prevalent in the community? These
and other questions will occur; in some instances
the answer will be at hand.</p>

<h3>MAKE A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</h3>

<p>The stockman should at least know the fundamental
principles of health and of any departure
from them that indicate disease. Hence a superficial
examination of the animal, as a whole, is in
line of diagnosing the disease. Note the general
condition of the body. The thermometer will advise
you rightly. Is there pain? If possible
determine this point and locate the seat of it. Is
the circulation natural? An examination of the
pulse will tell you if the blood is racing rapidly or
gliding slowly, and whether regular or rough. Is<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
the respiration as it should be? Count the number
a minute that you may know if the number
is more or less, or is as it should be. On listening
to the lungs, heart, and blood vessels, certain
sounds are heard which change with disease&mdash;normal
and heart murmurs. Whether or not an
organ contains air can be determined by percussion,
since solid organs, the lungs, for instance, in
pneumonia, give a different sound from those containing
air as they are normally. Air-containing
organs&mdash;lungs and intestines&mdash;may thus be distinguished
from the solid ones adjoining them. In
this way their varying size in health and disease
may be determined.</p>

<p>Your examination should go further and include
the natural discharges&mdash;the dung, the urine, the
nose moisture and the &#8220;look of the eye.&#8221; In cases
of fever the urine is scanty and deeply colored. In
Texas fever, for instance, the urine is dark red.
In azoturia in horses, it varies from a light color
to a deep brown or black. The nature of the dung
should be observed, if watery or dry, soft or hard,
scanty or profuse.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Taking the Pulse.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Stand at the left side of the
horse and run the finger along the lower jaw until
you come to the point where the artery crosses the
jaw on its lower edge. This will be found about two
inches forward from its angle. Right here is the large
muscle and at the front edge the pulsations may be
caught. To get the pulse of the cow, stand at the
left side, reach over the neck and take it from the
right jaw.</p>

<p>In the horse the normal pulse beats are from
35 to 40 per minute and may go to 100 in disease.
In the cow the pulsations run from 45 to 50 in
health. The pulse relates its story very accurately<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
and, with practice, can be constantly used in diagnosing
the nature of the ailment. For instance, a
soft pulse, one that is easily compressed by the
finger, indicates bronchitis. A hard pulse, one not
easily depressed by the finger, indicates acute inflammation.
A hard pulse may be quick and bounding
and forceful. An irregular pulse, one that beats
fast for a time, then slowly, indicates a weakened
heart condition. A slow, full pulse, one that comes
up gradually to the finger touch, indicates some
brain trouble.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400p" id="Fig24">
<img src="images/illo094.png" alt="" width="400" height="301" />
<p class="caption main">FEELING THE PULSE</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The heart beat, as it is called, may be felt by placing the
finger over any of the superficial arteries. The submaxillary
artery as it passes under the edge of the lower jaw close to
the bone is a convenient vessel for the purpose.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="inline">Taking the Temperature.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;While the heat of the
body may be surmised by touch and feeling this is
not a reliable guide as to the temperature. A self-registering
thermometer, inserted into the rectum,
is the only reliable means for getting this desirable
information. In a state of health the temperature
of the horse ranges from 100&deg; to 102.5&deg;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span></p>

<p>When the temperature rises, inflammation is indicated.
A fall in temperature below normal
denotes loss of strength, vitality, and death. If the
temperature rises three or four degrees above
normal, the case is serious, and a rise of five or six
is very dangerous. Animals seldom survive when
the rise reaches above 107&deg; or 108&deg;.</p>

<p>A good clinical thermometer should be in the
possession of every stockman. It costs but little,
and its aid in recognizing and treating disease is
helpful, if not absolutely indispensable.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Taking the Respiration.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;In breathing two
movements are observed&mdash;taking in and sending
out the air. In health the respiration is usually
constant, ranging from 10 to 14 in the horses, and
from 15 to 20 in cattle. Breathing is faster in
young animals; and exercise increases the number
of respirations per minute.</p>

<p>Any disease of the respiratory organs will cause
the breathing to be short and rapid and labored.
If the number of respirations seem more than
normal, some disturbance is indicated. If the pulse
is faster at the same time, illness is at once indicated,
and the trouble should be sought at once.</p>

<h3>THE TREATMENT OF DISEASE</h3>

<p>The first effort in treating disease is to remove
the cause. This is sometimes done very easily.
Mange and lice are quickly destroyed by washes
and disinfectants.</p>

<p>Bright, fresh, wholesome food and pure water
easily replace bad food and water to the permanent
good of the stock. Cattle ticks quickly disappear
when the grease brush is applied. And so in every
direction you take to fight the disease: find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
cause and then remove it, and half the battle is
fought.</p>

<p>If disease-producing germs cannot be killed at
the moment, it is still possible to diminish their
number or to modify their virulence. Thus to open
an abscess is to remove the pus-producing bacteria,
and hence to hasten recovery. To wash a wound
or open sore with antiseptics is the simplest way
to remove, diminish, and destroy the evil of the
sore.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400p" id="Fig25">
<img src="images/illo096.png" alt="" width="400" height="253" />
<p class="caption main">HOW HEAT AFFECTS
GROWTH</p>
<p class="caption sublong">At the end of 24 hours in
<i>a</i> but seven bacteria have
developed, the temperature
being 50 degrees. In <i>b</i> 700
have developed in the same
time, but in a temperature
of 70 degrees.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="inline">Helping the Body Fight.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;When disease sets in
a battle begins. One
combatant is the disease
itself, the other the body.
Your work is to render
assistance to the body.
In many cases your help
will not be needed. In
others you can render
incalculable aid. Here is
where medical aid begins
and ends: to care for and
nurse and make the body
strong that it may be victorious,
quickly, if possible,
but without fail, in the end. Medicines are helpful
if they diminish the work of the diseased organ,
giving in this way time for the body cells to bring
about a cure. Therefore rest and quietness are
advisable, that no organ may be called upon for any
effort but normal function and repair. A disease of
the heart calls for absolute rest, of the intestines
for little or no irritating or bulky or hard food, of
the lungs for no exposure. At times it is advisable
to check the activity of an organ, in which case a<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
drug may be given, like opium, to quiet the intestines,
or like aconite, to diminish the rate of the
blood flow.</p>

<p>In the same way external assistance may be rendered;
as, for example, sweating&mdash;to throw off
poison in the tissue juices; and blanketing&mdash;to
maintain an even temperature and to protect from
chill and draught.</p>

<h3>ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINES</h3>

<p>Medicines are conveyed into the body as
drenches, balls, enemas, and injections under the
skin or into the veins. There is nothing mysterious
about any of them.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Giving Medicines in a Ball.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The practice of giving
medicines in a ball is a very old one, and has
much to recommend it. Many nauseous agents
as aloes, opium, arsenic, asafetida, are thus conveyed
to the stomach without causing annoyance
and disgust to the patient. The balls are wrapped
in paper, dough, or gelatin capsules, and may
weigh an ounce or two. In giving a ball the following
plan is usually followed: Hold the ball
between the thumb and first two fingers. Now
seize the tongue at about its middle and gently
draw it out to the side of the mouth, in such a way
that the right hand may be inserted into the mouth
and the ball placed far back on the tongue, when
the hand is withdrawn, the tongue replaced and the
halter or strap wrapped around the jaws until the
ball is swallowed.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Giving Medicines in a Drench.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The drench is
usually employed for liquid medicines. It is best
to dilute the medicines with water, milk, or oil that
they may more readily reach the stomach and<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
at the same time exercise no injury to the structures
through which they pass.</p>

<p>In giving a drench exercise as much patience as
possible. To horses it should be given slowly. If
there is any disposition to cough, lower the head,
and then proceed as before.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Poultices.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These are made of a variety of things,
bread, bran, and linseed meal being the most common.
Any substance that will hold water and retain
heat will serve the purpose.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Mustard Plasters.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These are made with mustard
and water, cold water being the most desirable.
Mix to a thin paste. If the part to which
the plaster is to be applied is covered with thick,
long hair, a very thin plaster will more quickly
soak into the skin. This kind of plaster is most
commonly applied to the throat, the windpipe, the
sides of the chest, the abdomen and over the region
of the liver. To get the best effect for the last
named, apply on the right side at a point four or
five inches behind the back ribs.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Blistering.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The first step in blistering is the
clipping of the hair over the diseased part, and the
removal of dirt and scurf attached to the skin. The
blister is to be worked into the skin, and usually
ten minutes of rubbing will be necessary to produce
the desired results.</p>

<p>In the course of twenty-four hours blisters will
form, and some swelling in the region is likely to
be manifest. On the third day bathe the part with
warm water and soap. After drying, apply vaseline,
lard, or sweet oil. The blister should be repeated
if the results of the first blister do not bring
about a cure.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Firing.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The hot iron is a very useful agent in
treating many cases of chronic lameness and bone<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
diseases. In performing such an operation have
the iron at a full red and white heat and touch the
part gently with just sufficient pressure to make a
distinct impression. But one leg should be fired at
a time.</p>

<p>It is desirable to shave the hair closely to the
skin before applying the iron. The day following
the firing spread over the wound any common
wound oil like neat&#8217;s-foot oil or vaseline. Daily
applications are called for until the swelling subsides.
Unless a period of rest is given after the
operation, the best results will not be had. Many
bone diseases return, or are never cured, because
complete recovery never occurred in the first place.
Work and exertion only aggravate the cases, often
leaving them in a worse condition than before the
firing.</p>

<h3>CARING FOR SICK ANIMALS</h3>

<p>In the first place keep them clean. If necessary
wash them daily, especially the parts liable to get
filthy and dirty. In fever cases a gentle sponging,
every few hours during the day, is desirable.
Vinegar added to tepid water is very good.</p>

<p>Animals in feverish or chilly condition can be
assisted by blankets and bandages. These are very
helpful in warding off congestion of the internal
organs and in maintaining an even temperature of
the body. Any warm rug or blanket that is clean
and light will serve.</p>

<p>In bandaging the legs, endeavor to get an equal
pressure at all points. A long roll is, therefore,
best, and several layers should be wrapped around
the member. It is a good plan to remove the
bandage, replacing with another at least once a<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
day, and two a day are better. When a bandage
is removed, the skin should be washed and rubbed
with the hand and fingers, and the covering replaced
as promptly as possible.</p>

<h4 class="inline">Food and Drink.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;During sickness only easily
digestible food should be provided. Offer something
different from the ordinary, and let it be
prepared in an appetizing form. Nothing is better
than gruels and mashes. These are soft, nourishing,
appetizing, and easily digested. When active
nutrition is demanded, milk and eggs can be added
to the ordinary gruels or mashes.</p>

<p>Water should be available at all times. Small
amounts at frequent intervals are better than large
amounts at intervals far apart. In a few instances
only is it best to withhold the water. In treating
dysentery, diarrh&#339;a and diabetes water is usually
withheld, but in most diseases a free use is allowable
and desirable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="chapname">Diseases of Farm Animals</span></h2>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref1">ABORTION.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The expulsion of the fetus at a
period too young to live exterior of its mother is
known as abortion. This ailment may afflict cows,
mares, sows, and ewes, but is most common among
cows.</p>

<p>Abortion may be divided into two classes,
namely, accidental and contagious. If we had
nothing but the accidental form of abortion to contend
with we would hear very little about this disease,
owing to the fact that it is perfectly natural
for animals to carry their young full time, regardless
of how much they may be punished or abused
while in this condition if their system be free from
the germs of contagious abortion. On the other
hand, contagious abortion is a very destructive disease,
causing heavy losses to the stockmen of the
United States as well as to other countries. Contagious
abortion is divided into two classes, namely,
acute and chronic. Cows afflicted with the acute
form of abortion may lose from one to three calves.
Cows, after passing from the acute to the chronic
form of abortion, may carry their calves full time,
but are as badly affected with the germs of contagious
abortion as they were in the acute form,
when they were losing their calves.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest damage brought about with
cattle afflicted with the chronic form of abortion is
the shortage of milk. Animals afflicted with accidental
abortion show very few marked symptoms
before they abort. Animals afflicted with contagious<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]<br /><a id="Page103">[103]</a></span>
abortion have a number of marked symptoms,
namely, little red patches of infection on the lining
of the vulva, and there may also be present a
catarrhal discharge. The sheath of the herd bull
in the acute form of the disease has a catarrhal discharge,
while the symptoms of calves is a swelling
of the glands of the throat from ear to ear. These
last named symptoms do not appear in accidental
abortion.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that the germs of contagious
abortion are found in the mothers&#8217; blood, in the
genital organs of the cow and the bull, and in the
stables wherein they are housed, it has been positively
decided that the only reliable and effectual
treatment for contagious abortion is the hypodermic
treatment, which destroys the germ in the mother&#8217;s
blood. The genital organs of the cow and bull
should be washed out with the antiseptic solution
made of 1 pint of corrosive sublimate to 1,000 parts
of water, and the germs contained in the stables
wherein afflicted animals are housed should be destroyed
by disinfectants. In this way the disease
is met at every turn, and it is impossible for the
disease of contagious abortion to exist when thus
handled.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref2">ABSCESS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A collection of pus in a new-formed
cavity in the body. It has a well-defined wall surrounding
it. An abscess is the result of entrance
of micro-organisms into the body. They may have
entered through wounds or into the hair follicles,
or abscesses may result from infectious diseases,
as strangles or distemper in the horse. At the seat
of the abscess formation swelling occurs, the part
feels warmer than the surrounding tissue, is painful
to touch, and hard. These conditions are due
to the inflammation of the part. Later it becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
soft, less sensitive, and fluctuates, which shows that
it is coming to a head, or that the pus is collecting.
If the skin is white it will show a yellow color in the
center, which is usually raised above the surface,
and the hair falls out. This soon breaks and discharges
pus.</p>

<p>It is advisable to hasten the ripening of the
abscess by hot applications in form of poultices,
or a large pack of cotton saturated with hot bichloride
of mercury 1 part to 1,000 parts of water,
or use some one of the coal tar dips 1 part to 50
parts of water. The application of a light blister
will often hasten ripening. When the pus has collected
or the abscess has come to a head, it should
be opened at the lowest part in order to give free
drainage to the pus contained within.</p>

<p>Great care should be used in opening abscesses&mdash;not
to cut blood vessels which might be in the
vicinity. In case the abscess breaks of its own
accord, it is often necessary to enlarge the opening,
in order to give free drainage for the pus. If the
abscess is large or deep-seated it should be washed
out each day with bichloride of mercury 1 part to
water 1,000 parts, or with a 2 per cent solution of
some one of the coal tar dips. After it is opened do
not apply bandages, as they prevent the free escape
of pus. Do not allow the opening to close until it
heals from the bottom; or, in other words, as long
as it secretes pus, for there is danger of its breaking
out again. If the opening is too high up, or not
large enough, it may result in a running sore or
fistula.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref3">ACTINOMYCOSIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Called lumpy jaw, because
of the frequency of the swelling located on the jaw.
It is due to the entrance of a specific organism, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
fungus, into the tissues. This causes an inflammation,
with an increase in the amount of tissue, as
shown by the enlargement and in which an abscess
is formed. Adult cattle are the only animals commonly
affected with this disease, but occasionally
nearly all classes of domestic animals may be affected.
A number of cases have also been reported
in man, but the disease in cattle, being localized to
a small region of body, usually the head, there is
little danger of transmission from animal to man
in eating beef.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600p" id="Fig27">
<img src="images/illo105.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="382" />
<p class="caption main">LUMPY JAW</p>
<p class="caption subshort">An exterior view showing location of lumpy jaw.</p>
</div>

<p>The symptoms are recognized by the characteristic
tumor, usually observed on the jaw, either of
the bone or of the soft tissues in that vicinity. It
may, however, affect the tongue, or, in fact, nearly
any of the organs of the body. Its development is
more or less of a slow, constant growth, beginning
with a very small nodule, but, when allowed to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
its course, may reach the size of a cocoanut, or
larger. On reaching some size, it usually ruptures
and from it discharges a thick, yellowish pus. It is
to be distinguished very largely by its commonly
affecting cattle, its location, its slow growth and its
firm, hard consistency, and finally a discharge of pus
from it.</p>

<p>Treatment consists, if of small size in the soft
tissues, of complete excision by the knife. But, if
of larger size, or when the bone or large blood vessels
are involved, recourse should be had to the
internal administration of iodide of potash from one
to two teaspoonfuls in a drench of a quart of water,
or, in some instances, it may be given in the drinking
water once daily. This should be continued for
a week or ten days, when the treatment should be
discontinued for a like time, and, if necessary, repeated
several times.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref4">AFTERBIRTH, RETENTION OF.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This is a
condition resulting from the failure of the mother to
pass the membranes after the birth of her young. It
happens most frequently in cases of abortion, or
when birth occurs before time. There is usually more
or less of a mass of the membranes hanging from
the opening, which occasionally reaches to below the
hock, or even to the ground. When fresh it looks
somewhat like the intestines, but if exposed to the
air for some time it is grayish in color, especially
when it begins to decompose. The odor is very
offensive, and the discharge soils all the hind parts
of the animal. In these cases the health of the
animal suffers, and fever frequently results, with a
loss of appetite and flow of milk. The fever and
inflammation of the parts may go so far as to cause
the death of the animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span></p>

<p>The afterbirth should never be allowed to remain
over three days in the cow, nor over twenty-four
hours in the mare. In the mare, sow, or bitch
gently pulling on the membranes, at the same time
twisting them easily, will often bring them out
without injury to the animal. With the cow it is
different. Here the membranes are &#8220;buttoned&#8221;
on in tufts, and the pulling, and especially the
twisting, usually makes matters worse and injures
the uterus.</p>

<p>After removing the membranes there always remains
in the uterus a quantity of fluid, which should
be washed out with water a little cooler than the
blood of the animal, adding about a teaspoonful of
carbolic acid or other good antiseptic to each gallon
of water and mixing well. The hands and arms of the
operator should be absolutely clean, and during the
operation should be kept covered with carbolized
oil or carbolized soap and water. In mares, especially,
care should be taken not to injure the
parts, as inflammation sets in very much quicker
than in the cow. Several gallons of the above
solution should be injected as soon as the condition
is noticed, and a warm bran mash fed to the animal
occasionally will help her general health.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref5">ANEMIA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A deficiency of red blood corpuscles.
The animal is scanty of flesh, hide bound and in a
general run-down and debilitated condition. The
disease is sometimes called hollow horn. Treatment
consists of better food and care. The feed
should be of a nature such as will enrich the blood
and build up the system. Food of a succulent nature,
like roots, green grass, or ensilage, will help out.
A tonic, made as follows, will be helpful: Two
teaspoonfuls of sulphate of iron, 1 teaspoonful of
powdered nux vomica, and 4 tablespoonfuls of<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
ground gentian root. Add this to the food each day
for a week or ten days.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref6">ANTHRAX, OR CHARBON.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An acute, infectious
disease of plant-eating animals, which, under
favorable conditions, attacks flesh-eating animals as
well. It is caused by a microbe which enters the circulating
blood and by multiplication therein causes
its rapid destruction, and the death of the animal.
The disease is as old as human history. It exists in all
countries and in all latitudes. It was formerly very
destructive to human life, as well as to animals.
There is no disease which attacks more different
kinds of animals than anthrax, nor one which is
more deadly. Also, there is no disease which is
harder to deal with from the sanitary point of view;
nor harder to stamp out. The reasons for this
will be shown later on.</p>

<p>Soil is the prime factor in preserving and propagating
the microbe, when it is naturally wet,
impermeable, and rich in decomposing animal and
vegetable matter. The microbe of anthrax may
enter the body by several channels. It may be
taken in with the food or drink. It may be
breathed into the lungs. It may enter through
abraded surfaces on the skin. It may be inoculated
into the body by biting insects.</p>

<p>There are several forms of the disease and these
are determined by the modes of entrance of the
virus. One form, which occurs especially in sheep
and cattle, at the commencement of an outbreak,
and which is characterized by the suddenness of its
onset and its high degree of fatality, is known as
the apoplectic, or fulminant form. Without showing
any previous symptoms, an animal will suddenly
be seized with loss of appetite, trembling,
uneasiness, irregularity of movements, difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
breathing, blueness of the nostrils, bellowing, convulsions
and hemorrhages from the natural openings.
Death may occur in a few minutes or in four
or five hours.</p>

<p>Another type is known as anthrax fever, or internal
anthrax. Here we have distinct symptoms, the most
important being high fever of from three to four
degrees, excitability and restlessness. Blood may
ooze in drops from the nose, eyes, or ears, and from
inside of the forearm or thigh, in sheep. There
will be trembling, prostration, numbness of the
loins, thirst, grinding of the teeth, colicky pains,
bloating, bloody discharges, palpitation of the
heart, difficult breathing, blueness of the visible
mucous membranes, jerking of the muscles of
the back and neck, and rolling of the eyes. The
animal will die in comatose state, or in convulsions,
and death will occur in sheep in about a day.
Cattle will live from two to five days, and horses
from one to six days.</p>

<p>A third form is external anthrax, which manifests
itself in swelling of the tongue, throat, rectum,
and skin in cattle; and of the tongue,
throat, neck, shoulders, withers, flank, or thigh in
horses. These swellings have a firm, doughy feeling,
are not painful generally, and show a marked
tendency to gangrene. They never suppurate. If
cut (this should never be done), they discharge a
pale, straw-colored liquid. In this may be found
the microbe.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which putrefaction occurs in
an anthrax carcass is very marked. Another characteristic
is, the blood loses its property of clotting,
is dark and tarry, and does not become light in
color by contact with air, like normal blood. In
fulminant cases, however, these characters are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
so well marked. Other signs of the disease, if a
farmer should be so unfortunate as to open an
anthrax carcass and thereby spread the infection
on his farm, will be great enlargement of the
spleen, or milt, and also of the liver. Bloody
patches in the tongue, throat, lungs, stomach, and
intestines, caul, skin, and muscles, or in fact in
almost any part of the body, will be plainly visible.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref7">The Management of the Sick Animal</h4>

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;and disposal
of the carcass are the most important procedures
in an outbreak of anthrax, from a sanitary
standpoint. Medicinal treatment is of little value.
A vaccine has been discovered that is very effective
in preventing the disease. This has been used very
successfully in both this and European countries.
If a case of anthrax is suspected, call your veterinarian
at once. The disease will not pass through
the air from a sick animal to a healthy one, but the
discharges which invariably occur during the
progress of the disease all contain the microbe, and
everything soiled by them is infectious material
and capable of spreading the disease.</p>

<p>When an animal is infected, remove at once to
the burial lot and tie it near the place it is to be
buried, to save handling and scattering the infection.
When it dies, dig the grave. Then saturate
the animal with kerosene or coal oil and set it afire.
By means of ropes tied around the fetlocks turn
the animal, saturate the other side and fire that,
and also the soles of the feet. When every hair
has been burned off, dissolve a one-pound carton
of chlorinated lime (freshly opened) in sufficient
water to make a fluid that will just pour from the
cup. Fill the nostrils with this, also the mouth
and eyes, which should be pried open with a stick
dipped in solution. Saturate some cotton or rags<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
with the lime, and plug up the nostrils or mouth.
Treat the rectum likewise. Turn the animal into
its grave, sprinkle the ground on which it has stood
and laid with a strong solution of chlorinated lime,
and shovel the top layers of this soil into the grave.
Follow this with the grave soil, banking it up, as in
human graves. In cases where the animal is found
dead, the same method is to be pursued, except that
the animal is hauled to the grave on a sled (never
dragged over the ground). In these cases, also, the
place where it died must be disinfected by the same
means, after hauling out all loose material and
burning the same, as near as possible to the place
where the animal died. It would also be necessary
to disinfect the sled and all tools which came in
contact with the carcass.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref8">APOPLEXY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A ruptured blood vessel in the
brain; usually causes unconsciousness, at least for a
time. The control of certain muscles is lost and a
general dullness prevails over the animal. In case the
apoplectic attack runs a favorable course, the muscles
come more or less under control again and the
patient in time may recover. It is in rare cases
only, however, that animals recover to an extent
to be worth much after being affected with
apoplexy. Fortunately the disease in animals is
rare.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref8a">AZOTURIA, OR MONDAY MORNING
DISEASE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This is a very peculiar affection
of the horse, in which the animal shows a
special form of lameness upon exercise, after
having remained idle for a day or two. The
cause is not definitely known, and yet the
circumstances under which the disease develops
are rather constant, such, for instance, as an animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
in vigorous condition, fed liberally upon nitrogenous
feed, remaining idle over Sunday, a holiday or
at other times. Upon being taken out the following
morning the animal usually shows an excess
of energy, but before going far begins to go lame
in one or both hind limbs until, if urged further,
becomes completely paralyzed behind, going down
and unable to rise. He also shows considerable
pain, as though he might be suffering from some
form of colic, with a profuse sweating. On reaching
this point the animal usually ceases to void the
urine, which, when drawn, appears a very dark
brown or coffee color. The pulse and breathing are
somewhat accelerated, and frequently there is considerable
nervous excitement. The muscles of the
loin and thigh are tense and rigid.</p>

<p>The treatment should begin as soon as the lameness
shows itself. After a few hours of rest, the
distress will be over. The more exercise given the
animal after the lameness begins, the more severe
the trouble, and the more energetic means of treatment
required. In a case showing signs of nervous
excitement, it should receive 2 tablespoonfuls of
bromide of potassium every three or four hours until
becoming quiet. Sweating should be induced by
blanketing the animal well, preferably using
blankets wrung out of hot water and covered with a
dry one. Allow all the water the animal will drink
and give it 4 tablespoonfuls sweet spirits of niter
three times a day if bladder is not paralyzed. If
unable to void the urine, the bladder must be
emptied three times daily. A laxative or purgative
should be given early in the disease. If the animal
remains somewhat stiff, give a teaspoonful in the
feed twice a day of the following: Powdered nux
vomica, 4 teaspoonfuls; powdered sulphate of iron,<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
6 teaspoonfuls; powdered gentian root, 6 teaspoonfuls.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref9">BARRENNESS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Failure to breed is usually due
to an acid secretion of the genital organs, to the
germs of contagious abortion, retention of the afterbirth,
or to an abnormal condition of the sexual
organs of either the male or female. The acid secretion
of the genital organs prevents conception by
destroying the semen of the male; the germs of contagious
abortion set up a catarrhal inflammation and
discharge, which also prevents conception; retention
of the afterbirth, whether it be removed by force
or permitted to slough away, usually leaves the
womb in a diseased and catarrhal condition, effecting
a discharge; impotency may be due to excessive
use of the male, or to advancing age in both
male and female.</p>

<p>Any unnatural discharge irritates and scalds the
mouth of the womb so that when the discharge
ceases the mouth of the womb heals, and it is impossible
to make a cow or mare breed without
mechanical interference. This kind of treatment is
conducive to fertility by increasing the blood supply
to the part. Mechanical contrivances are now
on the market for the purpose of dilating the mouth
of the womb. These increase the probability of
pregnancy. If the womb be opened just before
service, many troublesome cases can be corrected.
This is done by inserting the oiled hand and arm
into the vagina, finding the opening into the womb,
and gradually dilating it by inserting one or more
fingers until the passage is open and free.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref10">BIG HEAD.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Just why bones become soft and
frequently are absorbed in normal animals is not
known, unless it is due to an absence of some
essential bone constituent in the food or water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
The disease shows that the bone is absorbed and
its structure softened. As a consequence, the bone
enlarges, becomes spongy and light.</p>

<p>The disease usually starts as a swelling in the
head, hence the name. Often the lower jaws are
enlarged, and, as the disease progresses, the legs
become affected. At the same time the animal
loses weight. The treatment consists of nourishing
foods, rich in the mineral constituents. Better consult
a veterinarian when the disease is first noticed.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref11">BIG JAW OF CATTLE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref3">Actinomycosis</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref12">BIG KNEE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Often cattle show large bunches
over the knees. These may be soft or hard. In cattle
these big knees are caused by hard floors, in lying
down and getting up. Big knee in horses is a little
different, being more in the nature of spavin or ringbone,
and in this case occurring at the knee joints.
In cattle the bunch may be localized in the flesh
and skin. With horses, it is an attack on the bony
structure. When first noticed a blister may be
used.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref13">BIG LEG.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref155">Lymphangitis</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref14">BITTER MILK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Frequently germs get into the
udder, and, as a result, bitter milk or blue milk or
bad milk results. Sometimes the bad taste of milk
is due to the odor in the stable or to the food that
the cows get while pasturing. Turnips give a bad
taste to the milk, as does garlic or wild onions.
If the bitter taste or the blue milk is due to disease
germs, then the remedy lies in the destruction of
these germs. Just after milking, and each quarter
thoroughly emptied, inject a warm solution of boric
acid.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref15">BLACKHEAD.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A germ disease affecting turkeys
and chickens. It is characterized by a dark purple
appearance in the comb and wattles. Fowls attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
by the disease show dullness and laziness; at the
same time indigestion disturbances and diarrh&#339;a is
observed. The best treatment is to kill the fowls
affected just as soon as they become affected. This
will prevent the disease from spreading. It is advisable
to burn the bodies of the dead so as to prevent
the spreading of the germs. Thorough
disinfection is necessary.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref16">BLACKLEG.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An infectious disease produced by
the blackleg bacillus, a parasite which lives and
propagates in the soil of infected districts and in the
bodies of diseased animals. Certain kinds of soil
are very favorable to the existence of the parasite,
and such, when once infected, easily remain so
permanently and thus constitute the source of the
disease. Years ago blackleg was regarded as a form
of anthrax. This has been proved erroneous, however,
for blackleg and anthrax are two distinct and
independent diseases, each being caused by a
specific germ. One diseased animal does not transmit
the disease directly to a healthy one. When
caused, it is the result of self-inoculation, that is, by
the germ entering a wound in the skin or mucous
membrane of the body, produced on the legs while
the animals are roaming over the fields, or at the
mouth while grazing; these are the places by which
the blackleg germs get into the system.</p>

<p>An animal dying of blackleg is fairly alive with
germs, which remain in virulent condition for a long
time. It behooves the farmer, therefore, to completely
destroy this kind of dead; not by burying,
for then the germs remain in the soil. The best
way is to burn the animal right on the spot where
it died. If the animal is moved to another place,
the infection is spread, thereby, and not only the
death place, but the grass over which the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
has been moved, should be thoroughly disinfected
that no germs may survive. The disease is characterized
in the appearance of large swellings on
various parts of the body, usually on one of the
upper portions of the legs, and never below the
hock or knee joints. Swellings vary in size, and
are always formed by the presence of gas that has
collected in the tissue just beneath the skin. This
gas is a product of the germ. You will notice a
peculiar crackling sound when you pass your hand
over these swellings. When punctured with a knife
these swellings emit a bloody fluid possessing a disagreeable
and sickening odor.</p>

<p>Associated with the disease are loss of appetite,
high fever and lameness. Death follows just a
few days from the time of attack. So far no medicinal
treatment for cure has been discovered. Stock
should not be admitted to infected regions. The
only safe practice in regions where blackleg is
prevalent is in the use of protective inoculation
or vaccination. Such vaccination renders the
animals immune, and even if attacked, there is
almost no appearance of the disease at all.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref17">Using Blackleg Vaccine.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The blackleg vaccine
now so well known is made from diseased flesh
taken from a calf that has died from blackleg. This
flesh, after being dried and powdered, is then properly
prepared and injected into the animal. There
are two kinds&mdash;a weak and a strong vaccine and
single and double vaccine. The single vaccine requires
but one inoculation. The latter is believed
to be superior and gives better protection. The
vaccine is usually available from the state experiment
stations, or can be obtained through your
veterinarian. About the only skill required in<span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span>
doing the work is in having the instruments thoroughly
cleaned and disinfected. A hypodermic
syringe is used and the injection made on the underside
of the tail, a few inches from the tip, or just
beneath the skin of the neck or shoulder. The
point of the syringe should not puncture the muscle
at all; simply pick up the skin and draw it away
from the muscle and admit the fluid in the loose
space between the two.</p>

<p>When vaccinated, the treatment is supposed to
last about a year. If calves are vaccinated the
operation should be repeated at about the age of
yearling. Two periods of vaccination are suggested:
when turned to pasture in the spring or
when turned to dry food in the fall. Full directions
as to the use of vaccines always accompany
the preparations and further detail is unnecessary
here.</p>

<p>Preventive medicines cannot be relied upon,
although a common one is used throughout the
West, made as follows: 4 ounces of sulphur, 1
ounce of saltpeter, 2 pounds of sulphate of iron,
and 1 pound of air-slaked lime. After being thoroughly
pulverized and mixed, this is added to one-third
of a gallon of common salt and used in the
place of salt.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref20">BLOATING IN CATTLE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This disease, sometimes
called hoven, is characterized by the distention
of the paunch or rumen, and is due to the accumulation
of gas. It most frequently occurs when
cattle or sheep are pastured on clover or alfalfa,
especially if it is moist just after a rain, or when
dew is on the ground, and when not accustomed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
fresh green food. I have known of many cases
where cattle have bloated from eating alfalfa hay
during the winter season.</p>

<p>There is no mistaking the disease. The animal
shows pain, goes off to itself, and breathes with
difficulty. Colic is often associated with bloating.
The most characteristic symptom, however, is the
excessive swelling due to the gas. The bloating
is noticed even over the back of the animal, the gas
continues to form, and, unless relief is secured, the
animal will choke and die as the result. Or some
suppression of the vital processes will occur, even
rupturing, with the same fatal ending.</p>

forward and plunge the instrument into the rumen.</p>
</div>

<p>Bloating may take one or two forms; a mild case
in which recovery gradually follows, and a very
severe form, where the only salvation is in tapping<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
to release the gas. If it is an ordinary case of
bloating, not very severe, ordinary remedies will
give relief. Turpentine in doses of 8 or 10 tablespoonfuls
is good. Some use 4 tablespoonfuls of
hyposulphide of soda dissolved in water, with excellent
results. Some veterinarians give doses consisting
of 4 tablespoonfuls of aromatic spirits of
ammonia in water as a drench. Ginger is frequently
given, as much as 4 tablespoonfuls diluted
in warm water as a drench. To keep the animal
moving about is excellent.</p>

<p>In severe cases it is advisable to tap with the
trocar and canula. Indeed, tapping is the last resort
if you would save the animal. These are inserted
on the left side of the skin and pushed into the
rumen or paunch, the incision being made about
half way between the point of the hip and the last
rib. In introducing the trocar push in and down.</p>

<p>After the insertion is made, the trocar is withdrawn
and the canula is left in to furnish an opening
through which the gas can escape. In case the
canula gets clogged with partially digested feed,
insert the trocar so as to push away the material
and withdraw it again. If the trocar and canula
are not available, then use a pocket knife. Of
course, be careful that the incision is not made too
large.</p>

<p>Just a few simple precautions are suggested here
as a prevention of this trouble. There is always
danger from bloating when cattle or sheep are
turned into green pastures, especially when not
accustomed to such feed and especially when wet.
It is advisable, therefore, to keep stock from the
pasture until later in the day when the dew has
disappeared. Stock should have their regular
morning feed just as usual before being turned on<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
the pasture. They will have less greedy appetites,
will not like to gorge themselves, and hence the
trouble will not be brought on.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref21">BLOOD POISONING.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;When blood poisoning
results from the entrance of bacteria into the circulation,
it is termed septic infection. This means
that the disease may be communicated to a healthy
animal by inoculation. Thus, an operator in making
a post portem examination may bring on blood
poisoning because of an accidental prick of the skin.
An animal may step on a nail or get a splinter in a
muscle or under the skin, and become self-inoculated,
in time becoming affected with septic
infection. Consequently bacteria are the direct
inducing factors. The chemical poisons produced
as a result of the work of these bacteria, as those of
putrefaction, may induce what is known as septic&aelig;mia.
On the other hand where pus is produced,
as in the abscesses which follow upon neglected
wounds in joints, a form of blood poisoning is produced
known as py&aelig;mia. In either case blood
poisoning may result, become very serious and
may cause the death of the victim.</p>

<p>At first chills may be noticed, then a rise of temperature,
quick respiration, rapid but weak pulse,
and much prostration. All the time the appetite
is disappearing, until it becomes lost. The mucous
membranes of the eyes and nose take on a yellowish,
red tint often showing spots or blotches of
blood and the tongue becomes coated and clammy.</p>

<p>Quick treatment is necessary in every case of
blood poisoning. As soon as noticed, the source
should be treated with disinfectants, thereby arresting
the supply of morbid matter. A strict employment
of antiseptics, so as to destroy the bacteria,
is the first essential. We look upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
prick from a rusty nail, or wound from a wire fence,
or a dirty stable splinter, as matters of frequent
occurrence, yet a great deal of danger lurks among
these. They should be avoided as much as possible
and in all cases immediately treated. As soon
as the poison is admitted to the blood or tissue, the
disease germs multiply and soon are present in
great numbers. Had the wound been cleansed with
an antiseptic like carbolic acid in the beginning, it
would have been a simple matter and the poison
would have been neutralized, and the ingress of
the invaders made unattractive, if not altogether
impossible.</p>

<p>In all cases of blood poisoning, look to a systematic
and constant application of suitable lotions to
the injured parts, to careful nursing, and to nourishing
food. If the appetite has completely departed,
it is often advisable to force food like eggs
and milk into the stomach, so that the strength of
the patient may never be dissipated or weakened.
With this treatment should go pure fresh air, cleanliness
and much sunshine. It usually is advisable
to call a veterinarian as early as possible.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A round, smooth tumor at the

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref26">BOT FLIES OR BREEZE FLIES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The larv&aelig;
or grub of all common bot flies are thick, fleshy
grubs and pass their life in some portion of the
body. When they are fully developed they leave
the body by some route and bore into the ground,
where they go through another stage of their development
known as the pupa stage. When this
stage is completed they crawl out of the ground as
a fly ready to deposit eggs.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref27">Horse Bot Fly.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Everyone is familiar with the
common nit fly and the yellow nit that is attached
to the hair on almost all parts of the horse, but
especially on the chest and legs. The young larv&aelig;
or even the egg may be transferred from these
regions of the body into the mouth by the horse
biting these parts. The grub passes into the
stomach where it attaches itself to the mucous lining
and continues its development. The bot is not
so dangerous as it is popularly supposed to be.
They may, when attached in large numbers to the
right side of the stomach, interfere with digestion
and be responsible for some of the digestive disorders
and colics. They are uniformly present in
the stomach of all horses that are kept in the open
where flies can get at them. A carefully groomed
animal may be free from them. The eggs may
be destroyed by rubbing the body with a rag wet
with kerosene. One of the most common remedies
for bots, and at the same time the most useless, is
a mixture of molasses and milk. Bots are hard to
dislodge from the stomach until they have completed
their development there and pass out of their
own accord. Half-ounce doses of turpentine three
hours apart until three doses are given, followed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
an ounce of powdered aloes as a physic, is a good
remedy and easily administered. Mix the turpentine
with half a pint of milk or gruel and give on
an empty stomach. Carbon bisulphide is a good
remedy. Take two drachms or one-fourth of an
ounce of this and shake with a pint of cold water
and drench. Repeat this every two hours until an
ounce of bisulphide is given, then give a physic of
aloes. These remedies should be given on an
empty stomach.</p>

<p class="caption main">HORSE BOTS IN STOMACH</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The bot fly lays its eggs on the hair of the horse. These,
taken into the stomach, hatch out and give rise to horse bots
or young maggots that attach themselves to the walls of the

</div>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref28">Bot-Fly of Cattle or Warbles.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;It is now believed
that eggs are deposited near the feet and
that the grub is taken into the mouth and becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
partially developed in the digestive tract. It then
burrows through the tissue until it reaches the
region of the back. The only treatment that will
amount to much is to destroy the grub as it is
developing under the skin. If farmers and stockmen
will systematically do this they can soon lessen
the damage done. The heel fly annoys cattle,
and the grub, when it escapes from the back,
leaves a hole in the best part of the hide, causing
loss in this way. After the grubs are in the back
no treatment helps the animal very much; but the
grub can be killed, thus preventing their developing
into flies that would annoy other cattle. The
grubs may be squeezed out and destroyed. Mercurial
ointment may be rubbed through the hole
and kill the grub, or chloroform, or creoline, may
be injected into the grub with a hypodermic
syringe. It does not require very much time to
look after the number of cattle usually found on
a farm.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref29">The Bot-Fly of Sheep</h4>

<p class="noindent"> is a very troublesome pest
at times, and always causes trouble and annoyance
to the flock when present, and occasionally causes
considerable financial loss. The fly attacks sheep
during the warm months, July and August generally
being the worst. The presence of fly in the
flock is easily told by the behavior of the sheep.
The fly looks much like a house fly, only it is longer
and it always attempts to lay its eggs just inside of
the opening of the nose. As soon as the fly begins
to get near the nostril the sheep will begin to run,
will hold their noses close to the ground, and frequently
huddle together as closely as possible for
protection. When the fly does succeed in depositing
the larv&aelig; it begins immediately to work its
way up the cavity of the nose and finally gets<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
into the small cavities in the head, where development
goes on. It is during this period of development
in the head that most of the damage is done.
As the grubs grow larger a discharge from the
nostril is noticed, which may soon become very
thick and sticky, gumming up the nostrils and
making breathing difficult. The sheep will often
carry their heads low, but will frequently raise
their heads and point their noses straight up.</p>

<p>The treatment may be either preventive or surgical.
The first is within the reach of everyone
owning sheep. Where only a few sheep are owned
each individual should be caught and a mixture of
tar and lard, or oil of tar and lard, applied to the
nostril with a brush. This can be done in a short
time and should be repeated every ten days or two
weeks during the warm months. Narrow salt
troughs may be made and the edges smeared with
tar so that the sheep will get tar on their noses
when they take salt. Turpentine may be applied
high up in the nostril by means of a feather. Begin
the preventive treatment early in the spring or
whenever you know by the action of the sheep that
the fly is bothering them, and you will have better
success than to wait until the sheep are affected
and undertake to cure them.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref32">BRONCHITIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A common disease of domestic
animals attacking the bronchial tubes. It may be
chronic, but is usually acute, and may affect one
side or both. The most frequent causes of bronchial
catarrh are colds. A sudden cooling of a
heated body by drenching, by the breathing of cold
damp air, may all bring on the disorder. Dust,
smoke or gas, when inhaled, often produces the<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
same trouble. Acute bronchitis usually sets in
with a sudden rise of the temperature of the body,
and the animal seems to have a chill. This may be
quite violent at times. The cough is noticed very
much as with people, being short, dry, and husky.
Later on, as the disease progresses, a frothy mucus
follows the cough. Associated with the disease is
a loss of appetite, constipation, and pains in the
chest and rattling in the chest and throat. A
favorite position of the horse is standing and of
other stock that of lying down. Good care is essential
in the treatment. That means, with good
treatment, dust, smoke, and bad air are to be
severely avoided. Plenty of good ventilation, but
no draft; and warm, well-lighted quarters are very
desirable. The animal should be blanketed to be
kept warm in the early stages and a compress placed
over the chest, with blankets over the compress.
Frequent changing of this compress is desirable,
say a change every hour or two. When the animal
is suffering from a chill, stimulants are excellent.
A tablespoonful of whiskey in a pint of water and
given as a drench every half hour or hour will be
helpful.</p>

<p>After the chill period is passed, small doses of
tincture of aconite, say 10 to 15 drops, in a little
water as a drench will assist in discharging the
mucus. When the animal has become at ease, a
mustard plaster applied to the lungs will help you
somewhat. From now on the treatment should
be good nursing and good food. Boiled flaxseed
and gruel will be very helpful. A very helpful
preparation may be made of the following: Nitrate
of potash or saltpeter, tartar emetic, ground gentian
root, equal parts. A half pound or pound in<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
all should be mixed thoroughly, and then a teaspoonful
given three times each day. When all danger
is passed, continue the careful handling and
allow two or three weeks&#8217; complete rest.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref33">BUNCHES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Bunches are most generally enlargements
of the bone. They are most serious in
the region of a joint. They are caused, as a rule,
by some injury, bruise, or wound. When first
noticed they should be treated with a blister to
insure a hasty absorption of the enlarged parts.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref34">BURNS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Occasionally animals are burned or
scalded so badly as to subject them to considerable
pain. This may be relieved by the use of a strong
solution of common baking soda. Following the
use of this, apply an ointment made of one part of
carbolic acid to 50 parts of vaseline. If vaseline
is not available, then use in its place linseed oil.</p>

hot, dry, and caked, and the glands inflamed. The
trouble may be due to external injury, to germs
entering the teats or to the milk being kept for too
long a time in the udder. As soon as noticed the
udder should be bathed in hot water and massaged
for several minutes. After being dried with a cloth
rub on a salve made of 2 tablespoonfuls of gum
camphor dissolved in 12 tablespoonfuls of lard. At
the same time give 4 tablespoonfuls of saltpeter
morning and night for two or three days. See

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref37">CALF CHOLERA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;When a new-born calf comes
into the world weak, puny, and listless, and dies in
a few hours after scouring, bawling, and blatting
and has sunken eyes and bloated belly soon after
death, the disease by stockmen is called &#8220;calf<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
cholera.&#8221; Many calves so affected are really &#8220;living
abortions.&#8221; They have just enough life at birth to
exist a few hours and show the symptoms described,
and such calves are usually the offspring
of cows that, during pregnancy, have been incompletely
nourished upon timothy or swale hay, or
coarse fodder, without an adequate supply of other
foods to balance the ration; or similar calves may
come from fat, flabby, corn-stuffed, beef-bred cows.</p>

<p>The trouble may be prevented by proper feeding
of the pregnant cow, but there is no cure. A majority
of such cases, however, are due to germ
infection. Cows affected with contagious abortion
may produce affected calves; the afterbirth and
navel cord are invaded by the germs in such cases
and the calf is improperly nourished in the womb.
In other instances, calf cholera is due to filth germs
entering the calf&#8217;s system by way of the raw navel
cord stump at birth, or the mouth when the calf
nurses from a manure-contaminated udder.</p>

<p>Prevent infective cases by providing a clean,
fresh-bedded, disinfected, whitewashed, sunlighted,
ventilated pen for the new-born calf, and immediately
wet its navel with a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>500</sub> solution of corrosive
sublimate and repeat the application twice
daily until the cord dries up, drops off and no raw
spot remains. Also wash the hind parts of the cow
and her udder with a two per cent solution of coal
tar disinfectant before the calf is allowed to suck
for the first time and repeat the washing twice
daily for at least a week. Isolate affected calves.
Bury or burn the dead.</p>

disease among human beings, it is, fortunately, however,
more rare among farm animals. The only
treatment worth while is in surgical removal of
the growths. If this be done when the tumors are
first noticed and when they are small, their further
appearance may not result. It is a good plan,
if the growths persist in presenting themselves, to
eliminate the affected animal from the herd. With
cattle, it is possible to prepare them for market
long before any cancer growths may reappear, and
in this way the full market value may be secured
with no danger when consumed.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref40">CAPPED ELBOW.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Frequently horses, in lying
down, press the foot or the shoe against the elbow.
This, in time, causes inflammation and ends in a
tumor or shoe boil. The diseased condition is difficult
to repair, as there is little flesh or muscle at
the joint of the elbow where the trouble starts.
Treatment consists of opening the boil and allowing
the fluid to escape. In case the swelling is
hot and painful, an application of lead acetate will
prove comforting and helpful. In preparing the
lotion, use 2 tablespoonfuls of acetate of lead to a
quart of water. There is no objection to injecting
a little of this into the opening. An injection of a
little tincture of iodine once a day into the opening
is desirable also. In treating cases of this kind,
it is a good practice to wrap about the horse&#8217;s foot
a pad of straw or hay for cushioning the foot. This
prevents the wound from being further bruised,
otherwise the cure may be greatly delayed, if not
indefinitely postponed.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref42">CAPPED KNEE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An enlarged condition of the
knee most commonly found in cattle. It is caused
by cattle getting up and down on hard floors. It
is usually seen in stables where stanchions are
used. A baggy tumor forms at the front and just
below the knee. In some instances this tumor becomes
very large and the cow walks about or
moves with great difficulty. Where hard floors are
covered with bedding, no trouble of this kind results.
Applications of hot water are excellent.
Liniment is also very good. Where the tumor has
long existed and is stubborn an opening should be
made at the bottom so that the fluid may be discharged.
A little tincture of iodine injected into
the opening once a day is good and at the same
time an application of iodine rubbed over the outside
will assist in reducing the trouble. Use one
part of iodine to eight parts of lard and continue this
treatment for a month or two.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref43">CASTRATION.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The removal of the testicles
from male animals. Castration is practiced upon
all the domestic animals. Only those male animals
possessing desirable characteristics are retained entire.
The operations are generally performed when
the male animals become troublesome. In horses
the time is usually at one to three years old; in cattle
one to three months old; sheep at one to four
months and pigs two to four months old. Dogs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
as a rule, become worthless if castrated. Cats grow
to an enormous size when castrated.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref44">Suggestions About the Operation.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;In the castration
of all the domestic animals some general suggestions
will be beneficial. (1) Secure the animal
so he cannot injure himself or the attendants. (2)
Do the castration during the early spring. (3)
Give the animal exercise after castration. (4) Boil
the instruments before operating, using warm
water and any good hand soap. (5) Disinfect the
skin over the scrotum before operating with corrosive
sublimate <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub>. (6) Wash the hands of
the operator with soap and water, then disinfect
with corrosive sublimate. (7) Great care should
be exercised that no corrosive sublimate be left
that stock may drink, as it is a deadly poison.</p>

<p>When the instruments have been boiled (sharp
castrating knife and emasculator), cast (throw)
the animal as carefully as possible. Secure the
hind legs so they will not hinder the operator. The
operator having his hands clean and the scrotum
washed and both his hands disinfected, and also
the region to be operated upon, the animal is ready
for the operation. The lower testicle is grasped
with the left hand and with the right hand an incision
is made over the testicle, down to the testicle.
The testicle is pulled upon until the cord is
seen. Then the emasculator is used to crush the
cord. This emasculator should be placed on the
cord as high up as possible. Some like their horses
castrated proud. This consists in leaving part of
the testicle. This last method is not safe, as it
allows the testicle to become infected and form
what is commonly known as water seeds. A
tumor grows on the cord and may become the size
of a man&#8217;s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span></p>

<p>After the testicle is removed, then enlarge the
first incision (cut) that was made through the skin
so as to give plenty drainage. This incision should
be about eight inches long for horses. By having
a large incision the upper part can heal first, and
there will be good drainage until the scrotum entirely
heals. If possible turn the castrated horse out
to pasture after the operation, and it will exercise
sufficiently to keep the parts from swelling. Do not
keep the animal in a dirty stable after it is castrated,
as there is so much danger from infection
in the dirty horse stable. If the horse is broken it
can be put to light work a week after the castration.</p>

<p>Bulls do not need to be thrown to be castrated.
The incision is made over each testicle, and the
operation carried out in the same way as with the
horse. Bulls are not so susceptible to infection as
the horse.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref45">CATARRH.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Commonly known as a cold, catarrh
is recognized as an inflamed state of the upper portions
of the air passages, with more or less discharge
from the mucous membranes. The eyes
often sympathize with this deranged condition, with
a watery state as the result. The causes of catarrh
or colds in animals are very much the same as
those causing the same disturbance in human
beings; as with people, so with animals, the malady
should be remedied as quickly as possible. Bad air
is one of the most frequently observed causes; consequently
pure cold air with proper blankets to
keep the body warm is considered the best treatment
for simple catarrh when unaccompanied with
other troubles.</p>

<p>One of the common symptoms is dullness and
loss of appetite. The hair stands out and looks<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
rough, a slight cough may be noticed and sometimes
a rattling is heard in the head. For cattle
a mild dose of physic, consisting of one-half pound
Epsom salts and 4 tablespoonfuls of sweet spirits
of niter mixed in a pint of lukewarm water and
given as a drench, is about all that is necessary.
If the cold hangs on, mix together one-half pound
of nitrate of potash or saltpeter and one-half pound
of gentian root and give a teaspoonful of this three
times a day until the animal is better. Of course
good food should go along with this treatment. The
horse should be fed soft food like bran mashes and
be kept quiet in a well-ventilated stable. If the
cold hangs on with him, mix one-half pound of
saltpeter or nitrate of potash, one-half pound of
sulphur, and one-half pound of ground gentian root
and give a teaspoonful morning, noon and night.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref47">CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A disease
fatal in violent attacks and not well understood as
to cause. It is believed to be non-contagious, although
frequently extensive outbreaks occur, suggesting
that it may be contagious. The symptoms
are not well defined, due, perhaps, to the fact that
other diseases are included under the general name.
Horses of all ages of both sexes are affected, and
temperament and physical condition have nothing
to do with susceptibility to the disease. Likewise
mules are affected and the mortality among them
is equally as great as among horses. The most
acceptable belief as to cause centers around a
bacterial organism that works in the membranes
of the brain. However, some writers attribute the
disease to ergot, smuts and molds supposed to be
taken with the food. Moldy corn and moldy hay
are believed to be associated with the disease. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
symptoms are staggering gait, partial or total inability
to swallow, various muscular contractions
and delirium.</p>

<p>Treatment is seldom effected, especially in
violent cases. Mild forms frequently respond to
cathartics, blisters on the neck, spine and throat.
These give some relief. Small doses of aconite are
also believed to be helpful. Some writers place
choking, distemper, grass staggers, and blind staggers
along with this brain disorder.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref50">CHICKEN CHOLERA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Chicken or fowl cholera
is a germ disease, and contagious. It attacks poultry
of all kinds. Diarrh&#339;a is a prominent symptom of
the disease. Bad food or improper food may aggravate
the trouble, but the germ introduced into
the system either in food or drink, is at the bottom
of it. At first the droppings will take on a whitish
color. Diarrh&#339;a will then result. The discharges
will then become thin and watery, to be at times
frothy and greenish in appearance. Fowls thus
attacked soon lose their appetites and become stupid
and take on a sickly appearance. The head drops
toward the body, the eyelids fall, and the fowls
stand around as if doped. Some recover, but, unless
checked, the flock will be materially injured.</p>

<p>Of course dead fowls must be burned at once and
lime and other disinfectants used to keep the disease
from spreading. The well birds must be kept
apart from the infected quarters. Care must be
exercised that infection be not carried either by
visitors or attendants from the sick to the healthy
quarters. A common remedy consists of 1 part of
sulphate of iron to 50 parts of water for drinking
purposes. Another common remedy is to mix a<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
tablespoonful of sulphate of iron, 2 tablespoonfuls
of dried blood, and 2 tablespoonfuls of tincture of
opium with a pint of water. This is given in the
food in doses of 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of this mixture
three or four times a day to each sick bird.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref51">CHOKING.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Horses frequently choke from too
rapid eating of oats, and cattle are very commonly
troubled on attempting to swallow apples, turnips,
or small pieces of ear corn. In either of these cases
much distress is occasioned and serious danger.
In treating the horse, the best treatment is to give
it a little oil, after which rub the hand up and down
the gullet to scatter the accumulated oats. Sometimes
it is necessary to make an incision in the
gullet through which the material is removed.
Better have a veterinarian do this. When food
lodges in the gullet of cattle, suffocation soon follows
if it is serious and in the upper part of the
gullet. When such objects have lodged near the
stomach end there is less immediate danger. Of
course the first treatment is to try to force the object
down by using the hand, if at all possible. If
this cannot be done a probang should be used. The
probang should be very limber, so as to bend easily,
and it should be used with great caution. Cattle
often are killed by the accidental puncture of the
gullet as the probang is pressed down toward the
mouth of the stomach. Consequently no unyielding
article like a broom handle or even a buggy
whip should be used. If a regular probang is not
available, a rope a little less than one inch in
diameter can be inserted and gently worked down
the gullet. Before using the rope, grease it well
and make a knob at the end to be inserted. This
knob can be made of cotton strings or muslin cloth.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref54">COLIC.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Colic is an inflammation of the bowels
characterized by a spasmodic contraction of the intestinal
walls. It is a very common disease in
horses, and occasionally cattle and lambs are affected
with it. Both the small and large intestines
may be afflicted or only one of them. There are
many causes, but feed and water are the controlling
factors. An animal just stopped from hard work
and given a large quantity of cold water, especially
after eating, may be quickly troubled. And the
animal hot from work, on drinking very cold water,
often gets colic. Then, too, a change of food, or a
change from dry feed to green food or eating some
root crop when the animal is not used to it, may
bring on the disease.</p>

<p>Then, again, some horses and cattle are more
given to colic than others. Some individuals are
never troubled, and others are almost constantly
under its influence. If much inflammation sets in,
a very serious case is on your hands. Two kinds
of colic are known&mdash;the spasmodic, a contraction,
commonly known as cramps of the bowels; and
wind or flatulent colic or bloating. Some authorities
add a third, and call it worm colic.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref55">Spasmodic Colic.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This kind of colic is first
noticed when the horse begins to paw with his forefeet,
cringes, bends his head around as if looking at
his side, lays on the ground and rolls as if in pain;
then he stands quietly for a while and repeats these
performances again. During the time between the
spasms the animal is more at ease and frequently
eats a little. When the spasms come on again the
shifting about and the rolling are repeated. If the<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
cramps are severe the animal breaks out with
sweat. The pulse is accelerated when the spasms
are on, ranging from 60 to 65 beats a minute. If
inflammation has set in, the pulse instead of rising
and falling remains more constant and is high all
the time.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500p" id="Fig31">
<img src="images/illo138.png" alt="" width="500" height="307" />
<p class="caption main">COLIC PAINS</p>
<p class="caption sublong">A common attitude with colic. When seized with pains
the horse paws, scrapes the ground with his front feet, stamps
and strikes the belly with the hind ones, lays back his ears
and looks around to his flank.</p>
</div>

<p>When the spasms are on, pressing the bowels
seems to relieve the pain and please the animal,
but if inflammation is present the pressure seems
to increase the pain. The best treatment is to
relieve the pain with an opiate, and next to obtain
a free action of the bowels by a purge. Many
prescriptions have been suggested, among which
is the following: 4 tablespoonfuls of sweet spirits
of niter, 4 tablespoonfuls of laudanum, 1 tablespoonful
of ginger and 1 tablespoonful of common
soda. These are added to a pint of warm water
and given as a drench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref56">Flatulent Colic.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This form of colic, though
not so acute, is much more constant than the preceding
form. The body is swollen in the region
of the bowels, the gas extending quite generally
through the region. There is also a tendency to
inflammation. The pulse will be noticed as more
rapid, and at the same time more feeble, the breathing
will be more pronounced, and the animal less
steady on its feet. In treating the patient it is
advisable to unload the rectum with greased hand
and arm, and the admission of warm water with
soap in it, is also likely to be beneficial. A little
turpentine mixed with the soap and water is good.
The intestine is to be cleaned out as far as the arm
will reach, but a violent purge is unwise, as that
only intensifies the inflammation. Naturally the
first thing is to mildly open the bowels. For this
give 15 or 20 tablespoonfuls of linseed oil and 5
or 10 tablespoonfuls of spirit of turpentine. If the
case continues, it is advisable to call a veterinarian,
and it may be necessary to use the trocar and
canula. If the instrument is sterilized, no great
risk attaches to the operation, while immediate
relief is secured as the gas passes out through the
tube, and the distention is visibly reduced. An
excellent mixture for this kind of colic consists of
6 tablespoonfuls of chloral hydrate, 6 tablespoonfuls
of laudanum, 3 tablespoonfuls of sulphuric
ether, 2 tablespoonfuls of turpentine, and 10 tablespoonfuls
of ginger. Of this give 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls
in a half pint of warm water and repeat
every half hour for 3 or 4 doses and then place the
doses an hour apart until all danger has passed.</p>

<p>When there is a good deal of gas with considerable
swelling an excellent drench is made of 2
tablespoonfuls of powdered aloes, 4 tablespoonfuls<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
of spirits of ammonia and 4 tablespoonfuls of sulphuric
ether. This should be mixed with a pint of
water and given promptly. In case of considerable
pain use this: 4 to 6 tablespoonfuls of hydrate of
chloral and eight tablespoonfuls of sugar mixed in
a pint of water and give as a drench.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref56a">CONCRETIONS OR CALCULI OF URINARY
ORGANS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The collection of solid mineral
matter in the urine may become lodged in
the kidney, the ureter (duct leading from
the kidney), the bladder or urethra (the duct
leading from the bladder). All animals are
more or less subject to these conditions, and yet
are not so affected as they are sometimes thought
to be. Many a case of so-called kidney colic is in
reality an affection of the digestive system. The
cause for these mineral accumulations perhaps varies
under different conditions, yet the most common
circumstance under which they occur is during the
time when animals are fed exclusively or largely
upon dry feed such as exists in the winter time
where silage is not fed. Wheat bran has been attributed
as one of the most sourceful means of
bringing on this trouble. When it is fed with succulent
feeds and an abundance of water allowed
these disorders do not occur.</p>

<p>The symptoms do not differ a great deal from
some forms of colic, due to stomach or intestinal
disturbances, especially in the frequent attempts
to empty the bladder. The animal usually shows
more or less pain from the restless condition, looks
around at the flank, dribbles his urine frequently,
which is occasionally blood stained. There may be
a complete obstruction of the passages, in which
case no urine is voided.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500p" id="Fig32">
<img src="images/illo141.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="396" />
<p class="caption main">RETENTION OF THE URINE</p>
<p class="caption subshort">By means of a catheter the greater portion of the urine can be
drawn off. The operation is shown in the picture.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref57">Treatment varies</h4>

<p class="noindent"> with the location of the trouble,<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
in which little can be accomplished when the gravel
or stone is located in front of the bladder. If
within the bladder, not obstructing its outlet, it is
not likely to make its presence known. Agents
should be given, however, to overcome the pain
and to relieve the frequently existing spasm at
point of obstruction, as far as possible, which may
allow passage of stone. Give 4 tablespoonfuls of
laudanum or chloral to a dose and repeat in two or
three hours if any pain or trouble is still indicated.
In inducing the animal to drink liberal quantities of
water the condition may be somewhat relieved by
making the urine more watery in character and
possibly dissolving a portion, allowing the
remainder to pass along its course. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span>
obstruction occurs within the urethra the removal
should be made by incising through the tissues on
to or near the obstruction, removing by forceps and
suturing up the wound. A skilled operator is required
for this, hence the veterinarian should be
called.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref58">CONSTIPATION.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An infrequent movement of
the bowels with the dung hard and dry. The animal
is said to be bound up or costive. Bad food, improper
feeding, lack of exercise, all contribute to the
trouble. Treatment is in the line of laxative and
succulent food, such as wheat bran, green grass,
silage and linseed oil meal. If the case is one requiring
immediate action give any of the usual
purgatives, but do not continue their use as a
regular thing. If green grass is not possible, nor
silage available, give one or two teaspoonfuls of the
following mixture in the food three times a day:
Equal parts of ground gentian root, powdered nux
vomica, powdered ginger and sulphur.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref59">CORNS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Small swellings or tumors on the sensitive
heel in the triangular space between the bars
and the wall of the heel. These are found in the
fore feet only, and almost always on the inside heel.
They are caused most frequently by bad shoeing
or from wearing the shoe for too long a time. These
growths do not always cause lameness, although,
as a rule, they do. They are, however, always sensitive
to pressure and usually appear as tumors of
a hard, corny character. Neglected corns are
liable to fester and must then be laid bare by the
knife and be poulticed. Neglect of this treatment
results in the matter or pus finding its way up
through the coronet. Thus quittor may result.</p>

<p>Give the foot a careful dressing by paring the
heel, and bathe the corn with a weak carbolic acid<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
solution. After doing this, place a fold of muslin
over the corn and then over all a bran and linseed
poultice. A complete rest from work, hard roads
and shoes should now be given the animal until
the corn has entirely disappeared. When the feet
are again shod, leather should be used as a protection.
Many corn salves are recommended, but
unless the corn be removed and the pressure taken
from the wound, there can be no cure, even though
the tumor is pared away.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref60">CORNSTALK DISEASE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;When cattle are allowed
to run in stalk fields it frequently happens
that a large per cent die from various causes. All
these troubles are classed under the one term&mdash;cornstalk
disease. In some western fields where
there is a second growth of cane stalk late in the
fall an early frost will at times develop in the stalk
a deadly poison (hydrocyanic acid), which kills the
animal in a very few minutes after eating it. This
poison has not been found in the cornstalk.</p>

<p>In the last year or two some of our state experiment
stations have been investigating several molds
which seem to affect not only cattle but horses as
well. These molds grow quite abundantly upon
cornstalks, alfalfa, and other forage crops. The
death of a great number of animals has been traced
directly to the feeding of such affected fodder, hay,
or corn. These molds, however, must have a certain
amount of moisture for their growth, and it
has been shown that when the feeds have been
properly harvested and sheltered no trouble has
resulted. Only in materials exposed to the weather,
allowing the development of these lower
forms of plant life, has serious trouble been found.</p>

<p>In the treatment of these troubles nothing reliable
can be given, as the disease usually comes on<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
without any warning and the animal dies suddenly.
Much of the trouble can be avoided by allowing
the animals only a limited amount of the feed or
in the stalk field a few hours only each day. It is
necessary that plenty of pure water should be given
frequently and enough of other roughage to keep
the animals from gorging themselves on the fodder.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref61">COW POX.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An infectious disease passed from
one cow to another. It affects herds in all parts
of the world and is similar to smallpox in the
human being, only it is not so fatal. When first
affected the cow is feverish, slacks somewhat in
the milk flow, and presents little red pimple-like
spots around the teats. In a day or two these become
enlarged and become blisters, containing
within a watery fluid, which, if not broken, dry up
themselves and form scabs, leaving the teat in time
perfectly natural. Ordinarily, special treatment is
not given. There is no objection, however, to providing
a simple tonic composed of one-quarter
pound saltpeter, one-quarter pound sulphur, and
one-quarter pound ground gentian root. Give a
teaspoonful of this night and morning in a mash.
The teats should be bathed, just before milking,
with any common disinfecting solution. If the
sores are slow in healing, sweet oil, to which is
added a little carbolic acid, will soon correct the
trouble.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref63">CRIBBING.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A habit of biting the manger or
other objects, often sucking in the air at the same
time. This bad habit is frequently called wind
sucking. It is the result of a habit formed when
young. There is really no cure when the habit is
once formed, but different measures may be employed
to lessen the fault. A broad strap firmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
placed around the neck brings the desired effect
with some individuals.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref64">CRIB SUCKERS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This bad habit usually begins
in colt days. It may arise from a sore tooth.
The colt, to relieve the feeling, bites the manger,
and in so doing acquires the habit. When hanging
on to the manger, air is sucked in and this frequently
brings on colic. The best treatment is to
break up the habit. Examine the mouth first to see
if anything is wrong with
the teeth. Muzzle while
standing in the stable.
The old cribbers never
give up the habit.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A sprain or injury
to the ligament situated
on the back part of
the hock joint. Anything
that puts too much stress
on this part, such as
holding back heavy loads
going down hill, or backing
up too heavy loads, or
the hind legs slipping
too far under the horse&#8217;s
body, may cause curb
disease. It is also caused
by kicks or by the whiffletree
striking against the
back of the hock joint.</p>

<p>There will be swelling
and heat in the part and
lameness. In some cases
there will be swelling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
but no lameness. If the swelling is hot and tender
to the touch, mix half an ounce acetate of lead and
two ounces tincture of arnica with one quart of
water. Shake up and apply a little to the swollen
part three times a day and continue until the heat
and swelling disappear. If there should be any
swelling after the heat and lameness have disappeared,
mix 1 teaspoonful of biniodide of mercury
with 4 tablespoonfuls of lard. Rub on a little with
the fingers, let it remain on for 24 hours, then wash
off with warm water and soap and repeat the blister
in three weeks if needed. In cases where there is
swelling, but no heat or lameness, the lotion would
be of no use, but the above blister should be used
as directed. In old or long standing cases of curb,
if the animal is not lame, it is best to let it alone,
as medicines would be of no service.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref67">DIABETES; PROFUSE STALING.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;In man
there are two forms of this trouble seen rather
frequently, but among domestic animals only the
insipid form is common. It is often simply a sign of
some other disease, but not infrequently occurs
under similar circumstances; such as certain forms
of indigestion, the result of eating musty or damaged
feed. The most characteristic symptom, of
course, is the frequent urination of liberal quantities
of urine. Associated with this is usually an
unabating thirst. The animal loses flesh rapidly,
the flanks are tucked up, the coat is dull, languid
and staring, and great weakness is shown. If not
relieved, the animal may die from exhaustion. In
the second form of diabetes, the distinguishing feature
is the presence of sugar in the urine.</p>

<p>If in a working animal it should be laid off
from work. Search should be made for the
cause of trouble. If any of the food appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
suspicious it should be substituted with
wholesome food. To relieve the ardent thirst
and assist recovery, a teaspoonful of the crystals
of iodine should be given in a ball of linseed or
other pasty material. It may be desirable to repeat
this in three or four days. Also give in the drinking
water 4 tablespoonfuls of bicarbonate of soda
three times daily.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref70">DIPPING LIVE STOCK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;There are only two
satisfactory methods of treating animals with a dip.
The first is hand treating, where the number of
animals are few and easy to handle. In hand treating
the animal the dip is applied with scrubbing
brushes, sponges, etc., and all parts of the body
liable to infection should then be thoroughly and
vigorously rubbed. If hand treating is properly
performed it is an excellent method. The second
method consists of immersing the diseased animals
in the dipping solution. There are two forms of
vats in use for this purpose. The cage vat is
designed for comparatively few cattle. As its name
implies, it consists of a cage in which the animal
is placed and then lowered into a vat containing
the dip. Where a large number of animals are to
be dipped, the swimming vat is very popular. The
animals are forced to pass through the vat, which
contains sufficient dip to completely immerse them
when they plunge into the solution.</p>

<p>The coal-tar dips are made from some of the
products of the distillation of coal tar. When
mixed with water they form a milky emulsion,
having a strong odor of coal tar. The coal-tar<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
preparations, in addition to being used as parasiticides,
have become very popular disinfectants in
hospitals. These preparations are used with good
success on all open wounds, where a disinfectant is
required. In poll evil and fistulous withers they
are extremely valuable, owing to the fact that in
addition to their power as a germicide they have
been perfectly safe to place in the hands of persons
not accustomed to handling drugs, because of their
non-poisonous nature. They have been found quite
efficient when used in three per cent solution.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref71">DISHORNING.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Some cattle breeds are hornless.
Most, however, are not. Removing the horns
is done quickly and is more humane than to permit
them to remain, by which death frequently follows
to stock and even to people. The dishorning machine
is intended for animals whose horns are
not removed when young. The simplest method
of dishorning is to use a stick of caustic potash.
Apply it to the small horn button when a calf is a
few days old. Moistening this and rubbing the
potash over the skin will permanently destroy the
horn tissue and no horns will result.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref73">DROPSY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A condition in which the fluid portion
of the blood escapes from the blood vessels and
collects in the body cavities or under the skin. Any
sluggish condition of the blood occasioned by disease
or faulty nutrition may induce this collection
in various parts of the body. Dropsy is, therefore,
not a disease, but a symptom of some other disease.
This being the case, treatment depends upon
the original disease, upon the nature of which depends
in turn the possibility of permanent or temporary
cure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span></p>

<p>A mild attack of dropsy is indicated when the
legs of a horse swell up, due to lack of exercise
and poor circulation as occasioned by standing in
the stable. The first thing, of course, is to start
better blood circulation. Hand rubbing is good;
bathing with hot water acts similarly. Any medicine
that stimulates the action of the kidneys will
prove helpful. Saltpeter is excellent for this. Use
once a day for three or four days in succession, and
give 4 tablespoonfuls at a dose. In connection with
this treatment supply the animal with succulent or
laxative food, that the bowels may be kept free and
open. Any of the tonic condition powders will
help.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref74">DYSTOKIA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref168">Obstetrics</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref75">ECZEMA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An inflammatory, non-contagious disease
of the skin in which eruptions may occur in
the form of vesicles, pustules, crusts, scales, or
simple redness. Its principal victims are animals
fed rich food, the penalty being associated with
some gastric or intestinal disturbance. Treatment
is both external and internal. The former should
be in the nature of washes for cleanliness and healing.
Tar soap is recommended. A wash made
of 4 tablespoonfuls of carbonate of potassium dissolved
in a quart of water is also excellent. After
a good rub with this, wash off with warm water.</p>

<p>If itching causes any distress, prepare a wash
consisting of 2 tablespoonfuls of acetate of lead, 8
tablespoonfuls of tincture of opium and a quart of
water. Where scales have formed and the skin is
thick and scurvy, rub in a little with the fingers
some biniodide of mercury and vaseline. Use 2
teaspoonfuls of the mercury and 8 tablespoonfuls
of the vaseline. One application will do the work.
If the case is bad, several parts being affected, treat<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
only one part at a time with the mercury salve. Be
certain to have the animal tied so that he cannot
get his mouth to the treated region.</p>

<p>For internal treatment let the physic come first.
For horses, mix 4 tablespoonfuls of aloes, 4 tablespoonfuls
of ginger and 4 tablespoonfuls of soda
carbonate dissolved in a pint of boiling water.
Let cool to proper temperature and give as a drench.
For cattle, give a pound of Epsom salts and 4 tablespoonfuls
of ginger in water as a drench. Following
the physic should come a good blood tonic. To
prepare this, mix 16 tablespoonfuls each of nitrate
of potassium and sulphate of iron. Give in doses
of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> tablespoonfuls daily in a bran mash until all
is used.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref76">DYSENTERY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An inflammation of the lining
membrane of the large intestine near the rectum,
accompanied with straining, discharge of blood, and
fever. Poisonous and irritating food causes it, stagnant
and foul water favors its development, but any
exposure to cold or excessive heat or overwork
may bring it on. In cattle the acute form is attended
with shivering, arching of the back and
tenderness about the loins. The animal grunts,
yawns, grinds its teeth, and, at short intervals, discharges
from its bowels a thin, ill-smelling dung
mixed with blood and pus. The thirst is excessive,
the animal is dull and stupid, and loses flesh rapidly.
After the disease has gone on a few days, the hide
becomes rough and unhealthy, the teeth loose, the
dung bloody and fetid, the eyes sink in the head and
dropsical swellings appear about the lower jaws
and legs, and usually the creature dies exhausted.
For acute dysentery, when seen early, give horses
a drench consisting of 15 tablespoonfuls of castor
oil, 8 tablespoonfuls of laudanum, and 1 pint of<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
linseed oil. The rectum and lower bowel should
be washed out with large injections of simple warm
water. For chronic forms 10 grains of calomel, a
teaspoonful of opium, and 4 tablespoons each of
gentian and chalk are advised. These are to be
mixed and given either as a ball or as a drench once
a day. Six tablespoonfuls of laudanum in a pint
of boiled starch every two hours until the straining
ceases, is also very good. When cattle are affected,
remove from grass or other succulent food, put on
a dry diet and give a pint of linseed oil every day
until recovery. If the action of the bowels does
not cease promptly, give 2 tablespoonfuls of powdered
alum and 2 tablespoonfuls of powdered ginger
in a quart of milk once or twice a day until the discharge
moderates. An excellent medicine is 10
tablespoonfuls of castor oil and 4 tablespoonfuls
of laudanum mixed with linseed gruel and given
as a drench.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A parasitic fungus that grows on
different species of grass and produces in one stage
of its development black or purple enlarged spurs
causes ergotism. The disastrous effect of ergot
seems to appear in the late fall and winter, when
hay or straw infected with ergot are continuously
fed. The animals will be troubled with irritation
of the bowels and a sloughing off of the extremities.
Frequently the animals lose parts of their
tails or ears or hoofs. In others, gangrenous sores
appear. In the early stages of the poisoning
the symptoms are not clearly marked. The
best treatment is secured by an entire change
of food, so as to remove the cause, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
to follow with good laxative food. Of course,
medicinal treatment will not be satisfactory if an
important part of the animal like the hoof were to
be destroyed. So much expense would be connected
with keeping the animal until a new hoof
had been formed that it is better at the beginning
to destroy the animal unless very valuable. Where
sores only manifest themselves such treatment as
given an ordinary wound will be efficacious, provided
food absolutely free of ergot is supplied.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref81">ERYSIPELAS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An inflammation of the skin
and tissues beneath. Owing to a blood poison, it is
characterized by a swelling and hardness of the
affected parts which has a tendency to spread and
form abscesses. In horses and cattle, erysipelas
is nearly always the result of wounds and generally
of those in the legs of animals weakened by hard
work and poor food, or else in young animals whose
blood is vitiated by the poison of glanders or some
other animal contamination. The disturbance is
noticed on the third or fourth day after the injury
in the immediate neighborhood of the wound. The
skin is swollen, smooth, hot, tender, and painful.
The swelling gradually extends around it, sometimes
deep into the muscles. The surface is hard
and tense, but often when the finger is firmly pressed
upon it and withdrawn a depression is left. In severe
cases chills occur, the pulse is weak and quick, the
breathing hurried, the bowels constipated and the
urine scanty and highly colored. There is considerable
thirst, but no appetite. A brisk purge is
the first step in treating. Follow the purge with
tincture of chloride of iron, 4 teaspoonfuls in a pint
of water. Give this every three or four hours. At
the same time give internally 4 tablespoonfuls of
hyposulphite of soda in a pint of water three times a<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
day. Externally bathe the wound with the following
mixture: Tincture of chloride of iron, 4 tablespoonfuls,
and alcohol one pint. Another good
ointment is sugar of lead 4 tablespoonfuls in a
pint of water. This should be applied with a wet
cloth to the diseased parts.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref82">FARCY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref103">Glanders</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref83">FEVER.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Any rise in temperature above the
normal. It is, as a rule, a symptom of the body&#8217;s
reaction to some form of infection. It is, therefore,
not a disease in itself, but an indication of
some disorder occasioned by infection or poison.
To treat fever is not so necessary as to remove the
cause that brought about the disturbance in the first
place. It follows from this that fever is not a
cause, but a result. Germs come first, and fever
is only a sign that tells of their presence. Another
thing brought to light in reference to fever is this:
Germs are less active, their vital energy is weakened
and their power lessened when the heat in the body
is increased. Consequently they are less active in
their destructive tendencies as the temperature rises.
Fever is, therefore, a provision of self-defense, and
the body&#8217;s plan of bringing its forces together to
battle against the germ foes that have invaded it.</p>

<p>Just what degree of temperature is to be considered
is difficult to establish. Many things enter
into the problem, like exercise, age, food, and mode
of living. In general, however, any special rise
above the normal, whatever that may be, is the
signal of danger and infection. A rise of a degree
or two indicates a mild disturbance, hence a mild
fever; an elevation of two or three degrees indicates
a slight fever; of four or five, of considerable
fever; and if six or seven, of high fever. When
the elevation reaches 108 degrees, the limit of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
has just about been reached. In some diseases there
is a regular alternative between morning and evening
temperatures. In others, the course is continuous,
with slight variations, while in others the
course is intermittent. In this last named it varies
at different portions of the day, but reaches a
normal at a certain time each day.</p>

<p>The pulse-rate usually bears a certain relation
to the height of the disease. Consequently the
pulse should be taken in connection with the fever
height indicated by the thermometer. A fast pulse
and a high fever in general is more serious than a
high fever with a pulse only slightly above the
normal number of beats. There are exceptions to this
however, as, for instance, in cerebro-spinal meningitis.
In the early stages of fever, the development
cannot at the moment always be decided. In
many cases little treatment, if any, will be necessary.
The caution should be observed, nevertheless,
of ascertaining the cause of the disturbance, if
possible. In any case, simple cathartics can be
given, good air provided, nourishing feed supplied,
and time allowed for careful observation of the
system and of the actions and movements of the
animal.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref84">FISTULAE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A chronic discharge from some
tubelike channel, with no tendency to heal. Fistul&aelig;
are most common in horses. They may be located on
the withers (fistulous withers), on the side of the
face (tooth fistul&aelig;), on the breast bone (sternal
fistul&aelig;), or on the lower jaw (salivary fistul&aelig;).
Fistulous withers are caused from some external injury
(the animal rolling on a rock, ill-fitting collars,
the saddle pressing on the withers, or from being
struck by a club). Tooth fistul&aelig; are caused by a
decayed tooth. The pus in trying to get out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
body takes the easiest course and eats through the
bones of the face and escapes, causing a chronic
discharge. A sternal or breast fistula is caused by
some sharp object being run into the breast and
striking the breast bone, injuring it and causing
decay and pus formation. A salivary fistula is
caused by an injury to the tube which carries the
saliva from the gland to the mouth.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref85">Symptoms of Fistulous Withers.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;At first a large
swelling appears on one or both sides of the withers.
In about a week this enlargement becomes soft, and
the fluid contained in it can be distinctly felt. If
left to itself the swelling gets larger and softer, and
in a month or so breaks and discharges the contents.
The fluid that comes from the swelling is
first thin and streaked with blood; later it contains
yellow-appearing masses. The last material is the
pus. The sack that formed at the time the fistula
was caused is a hard, firm membrane. This keeps
the wound from healing. For this reason the discharge
becomes chronic. The wound may heal and
there will be no pus discharged for a month, then
the old opening will be broken and the pus will flow
out again until the sack is emptied. This healing
of the wound and then breaking again may be kept
up for years, unless the disease is properly treated.
As a general rule, the affected animal runs down
in flesh.</p>

<p class="caption main">FISTULOUS WITHERS</p>
<p class="caption sublong">Sometimes only the skin and tissue immediately under it
become affected. In such cases little trouble need be anticipated;
but if the cause is not removed, the deeper structures,
muscles and bones, may become diseased.</p>
</div>

<p>Treatment for fistulous withers consists of opening
the swelling and inserting muslin strips that
have been dipped into terchloride of antimony. Insert
one and remove, inserting another and leave
in the opening for three or four hours. Repeat
this operation every four or five days for a month.
In addition rub on the outside of the swelling once
every two weeks a mixture made of 2 teaspoonfuls<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
of cantharides and 4 tablespoonfuls of lard. The
tooth fistula usually calls for the removal of the
tooth and thorough disinfection of the opening from
the face through to the mouth. With a sternal fistula
the diseased bone may need to be scraped and then
antiseptic washes used daily. The salivary fistula
is more difficult to treat. Better have the veterinarian
to examine, and an operation may be necessary.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref86">FITS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Some horses are subject to fits, and with
them it is incurable. These should not be driven,
because, when the attack comes on, injury may
result to the animal itself and to the occupants in
the carriage. The cause of the difficulty may be
overfeeding, bad circulation or indigestion. When
an attack occurs the best treatment is to throw
cold water over the head. If this attack is repeated
you had better consult a veterinarian.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref54">Colic</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref88">FLEAS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Fleas are always a nuisance and always
disagreeable. They live in dry, filthy quarters and
associate with dogs, hogs, and chickens. To keep
fleas away or to destroy them when at hand, clean
the quarters occupied by the animals, destroy the
bedding and add lime and disinfectants. Dogs may
be washed in a creolin solution of, say, 2 tablespoonfuls
of creolin to each pint of water. To disinfect
chicken, hog, and horse pens use in a hand
spray any of the so-called sheep dips or other
preparations manufactured for lice, itch, mange, or
insect troubles.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref89">FLIES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These pests are a nuisance on every
farm. While they do not directly cause death they
greatly worry and irritate farm stock, especially in
summer, and in this way greatly affect the results
whether along dairy or beef lines. It would be
impossible to estimate the misery these pests inflict
on the stock of the country during a single year.
Aside from the pain that flies inflict on domestic
animals, they are carriers of disease, both to the
human family and the beast family. A great many
common infectious diseases are spread by flies, including
such serious diseases as typhoid fever and
tuberculosis. The only treatment is in way of prevention.
As the breeding places are in filth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
manure, it follows that if these be destroyed or
removed, and not permitted to accumulate, the
floods of flies will disappear. The fly remedies
now on the market are excellent. When sprayed
about the stable premises and on the animals the
flies stay away until the application evaporates.
Darkened stables are not attractive to flies, and
by this means the nuisance and annoyance is minimized.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref90">FLUKES, LIVER.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref146">Liver Flukes</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref91">FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This malady
generally affects ruminants, but, although found
most often in cattle, sheep, and goats, it may be
transmitted to swine, and, in some instances, to
horses, dogs, cats, birds, or human beings. In most
cases where proper disinfection is made the animal
recovers in about 15 days. The most dangerous
thing about foot and mouth disease is the fact that
it spreads so rapidly. The virus which transmits
the disease may be carried by railroad cars, bedding,
feeds, dairy products, dogs, cats, birds, or persons.
A dog running through a pasture may be the means
of infecting a whole herd.</p>

<p>The cause of the disease has not been satisfactorily
determined, but it is definitely known that the
virus which reproduces the disease comes from the
ulcers and natural secretions and excretions of
the body, such as milk, saliva, perspiration, feces,
urine, and exhalation. The contagion is not harmful
when dried. Infected animals lose the power of
transmitting the disease when the ulcers of the
mouth, feet, and udder have healed.</p>

<p>In from three to five days after infection the
animal has a moderate fever. The appetite is lost
and the mouth is kept closed. There is a dribbling
of saliva, and in two or three days yellowish-white<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
spots the size of a hemp seed appear on the gums,
the lower surface of the tongue, lining of the mouth
and on the lips. These eventually attain the size
of a silver dollar. They run together, burst and
form painful, foul-smelling ulcers. At this stage
the saliva is more profuse and ropy and the animal
makes characteristic smacking noises with the
mouth.</p>

<p>Infected animals lose flesh rapidly, in some cases
as much as 100 pounds in eight or ten days. The
milk is thick, yellowish-white, has a bad taste, and
is with difficulty made into cheese or butter. The
reduction in milk yield during the sickness and for
some time after recovery is 50 to 75 per cent.</p>

<p>Usually, a short time after an appearance of the
disease in the mouth parts, there is a redness, heat
and swelling of the skin at its junction with the
hoof and especially between the toes and upon
the soles of the foot. Similar ulcers to those on the
mouth appear on the feet and soon burst. The
animal becomes lame and moves stiffly and lies
down a great deal. These ulcers ordinarily heal
up in one or two weeks.</p>

<p>In some cases the animal dies suddenly, in others
lingers a few hours with difficult breathing and discharge
of blood from the nose, and finally dies of
paralysis of the heart and lungs. In still other
cases emaciation and reduction of milk flow is the
only bad result. Sometimes ulcers form at the root
of the horn and cause the horn to drop off.</p>

<p>Owing to the nature of the disease, its contagion
and danger, treatment should be in line of prevention
and in destruction of infected animals. While
the disease yields to treatment, our best suggestions
when the disease is suspected is in notification
to the state officers and in securing the services of<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
a veterinarian who will be able to advise what is
best to do.</p>

sometimes so serious that
the entire hoof rots away.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref93">FOOT ROT IN SHEEP.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A chronic inflammation
of the foot, marked by ulceration, softening of
the hoof, lameness, and the discharge of a sticky
material which has a very fetid odor. It is a contagious
disease, and is produced by a germ that
lives in the soil and gains entrance to the feet
through wounds and surfaces chafed by barbed
grasses and stones, or by
gritty clay, which becomes
lodged between the toes and
hardens there.</p>

<p>The first symptom is a
slight lameness. If the affected
foot be examined,
that part just above the
horny part of the cleft of
the foot, either in front or
behind, will be found inflamed,
feverish, and moist.
Erosions or ulcers soon
appear, generally on the
heel. These penetrate the foot and burrow
beneath the horny parts, causing fistulous tracts
from which exudes a foul-smelling pus possessing
an odor sufficiently characteristic to indicate the
disease in a flock, even without a close examination.
In time, the foot becomes greatly overgrown and
deformed, the hoofs increasing in length and curling
upward. In bad cases, the suffering is so great
the animal lies down most of the time, but when
only the front feet are diseased, it will crawl
around on its knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span></p>

<p>That the disease is contagious is shown by the
fact that it generally starts in one foot and spreads
to the others, and, at the same time, the feet of
other sheep in the same flock become diseased in
the same way, the outbreak covering a period of
several months. In cases that recover spontaneously
the foot is deformed and the joint is stiffened.
It is only in virulent outbreaks where all
the feet are diseased, or where some complication,
such as maggots, is present, that deaths occur.</p>

<p>Having as its cause a microbe, it is proper to
take measures of prevention as well as cure. In
purchasing sheep, it is highly advisable to keep
them isolated for a week, as a test. All overgrown
hoofs should be trimmed. Sores or wounds, from
any cause, should be carefully disinfected daily.
Low, boggy lands should not be used as pasture
for sheep, and dirty, unsanitary pens should be
made sanitary, as these all predispose to an outbreak
of the disease.</p>

<p>As treatment, first isolate all affected animals.
Mild cases are best treated by making the sheep
stand for several minutes daily in a trough containing
a disinfectant, or, better still, by arranging
the trough of suitable length with fenced-up sides
and a widened entrance, so the sheep can be easily
started into the inclosure and made to wade through
the disinfectant.</p>

<p>In bad cases and where the hoof is underrun with
pus, the horn and all overgrowths must be cut
away so as to expose the diseased parts to the
action of the disinfectant. The foot should then be
dried, dusted with finely powdered burnt alum,
and bandaged to keep out the dirt. This antiseptic
treatment of the feet must be kept up daily as long
as the disease exists. Any of the following may<span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span>
be used: 1 pound chloride of lime to 12 quarts of
water; 1 pound of pure carbolic acid to 4 gallons
of water; a solution of creolin; a coal-tar disinfectant
of the same strength; or any good sheep
dip containing these substances in the proper
amounts.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref94">FOUNDER.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An inflammation of the sensitive
or soft structures between the hoof and bones of the
foot. The popular belief that founder is to any
extent in the legs and chest is probably an error.
The disease is in the feet, and those symptoms
which make it appear as a stiffness in the legs and
shoulder are but the natural results of soreness in
the feet. The same statement might be made regarding
those cases which are popularly described
as &#8220;stove up in the shoulder.&#8221; Instead of the
soreness being in the shoulder in these cases, it is
generally in the feet, or at least below the knee.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to explain how those
influences or causes which are known to produce
founder bring about that condition, but observation
shows clearly that an irritation of the digestive
tract, or in fact, any extensive irritation of any
mucous surface, may produce an inflammation of
the sensitive lamin&aelig; of the feet; that is, founder.
Therefore founder may be produced by a change
of feed or excessive feeding, a change of work or
excessive work which results in exhaustion, large
quantities of feed or water when warm or fatigued,
sudden changes of temperature such as cooling too
fast when sweating, and a long drive on hard roads,
especially without shoes. Excessive purging or
diarrh&#339;a may also produce it. Founder also occasionally
results from irritation of foaling, but this
is not common.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span></p>

<p>There is no essential difference in the nature of
the disease determined by the particular agent or
condition which causes it. &#8220;Water founder,&#8221; and
that produced by over-feeding, concussion, or extreme
fatigue are, in so far as the character of the
disease is concerned, one and the same thing.</p>

A typical foundered
foot is pictured here.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref95">Founder May Occur</h4>

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;in the fore or hind feet or
in both; but generally the fore feet are those affected.
A stiffness and disinclination to move are
perhaps the first symptoms noticed. The position
in which the animal stands is characteristic. The
fore feet will be placed
well forward, so that the
weight will be borne by
the heels, while the hind
feet are brought well up
under the body in order
to take as much weight
off the front feet as
possible. This position
gives a rather unsteady
appearance to
animal, and the hind
feet are frequently
shifted in order to maintain as steady a position
as possible. From this fact founder is
frequently mistaken by inexperienced persons for a
disease of the kidneys. The body temperature is
usually considered increased; that is, there is fever&mdash;as
it is generally expressed&mdash;due to inflammation
in the feet. As is usual in the first stages of
inflammation, the pulse beat is increased in frequency
and force. An increase of heat in the feet,
with a manifestation of pain when the hoofs are
tapped with a hammer, are, when taken with all
the foregoing facts, sufficient evidence of founder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
When founder occurs in one foot, however, as it
sometimes does, the diagnosis may be more difficult
for the inexperienced. When it occurs only
in the hind feet the position which the animal takes
will not be different from that taken with founder
in only both fore feet but from different causes.
The hind feet are brought well forward under the
body, but for the purpose of throwing such little
weight as is borne on them on the heels.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref96">The Feet Should Be Kept Moist.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Remove the
shoes and apply moisture to the feet. The latter
may be done by standing the animal in water five
or six inches deep each day, several hours at a
time, or by the application of a poultice of wheat
bran or some such material, or by wrapping the
feet with cloths and keeping them thoroughly
saturated with water. The animal should always
be encouraged to lie down and take the weight off
his feet, which is beneficial. When this occurs, a
poultice of some sort must be used to apply moisture
to the feet. It may be applied by the use of
a sack large enough to envelop the foot and hold
sufficient of the poultice to retain the moisture for
some time. This application of moisture to the
feet should be continued until the severity of the
inflammation and the lameness have subsided.</p>

<p>Unless the founder be due to excessive purgation,
a quart of raw linseed oil should be given as
a purgative. During the first 48 hours from 30
to 40 drops of tincture of aconite may be given
every three or four hours. Four tablespoonfuls of
nitrate of potash (saltpeter) should also be given
three times a day in the feed or on the tongue. If
the lameness continues after the acute symptoms
have subsided, a rest of several weeks on a soft
pasture and the application of a blister around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
top of the hoof are recommended. The following
mixture has been useful as a blister: Red iodide
of mercury, 1 part; lard, 4 parts; cerate of cantharides,
4 parts. Apply around the top of the
hoof, except at the heels, and rub for 10 to 15
minutes. The animal should be tied so that it cannot
get its mouth to the blistered part for several
hours after the medicine has been applied.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref97">CHRONIC FOUNDER.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;In a majority of cases
the above treatment will be followed by a good
recovery, but an animal once foundered is probably
more likely to suffer from a subsequent attack. If
the lameness does not entirely disappear in a week
or ten days, it is seldom that a complete recovery
takes place. In such cases the animal is likely to
remain unfit for road work and to continue to show
more or less soreness. These are the cases that
are later said to have &#8220;chest founder,&#8221; or &#8220;stove
up in the shoulder,&#8221; owing to the fact that the
muscles of the chest waste away from lack of free
use.</p>

<p>In some cases still more serious results follow
an acute attack of founder. The inflammation may
be so severe that there is separation between the
hoof and structures, the formation of pus, and a
descent of the central organs of the foot, which
causes a bulging of the sole. In such cases, even
though recovery takes place to such an extent that
it is advisable to allow the animal to live, it is not
fit for work, and can only be used for breeding
purposes.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref98">FOWL CHOLERA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref50">Chicken Cholera</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref99">GAPES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A symptom caused by worms in the
windpipe; oftenest seen in young chicks and turkeys.
Birds droop, cough, and lower their wings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span>
A feather moistened, but not dripping, with kerosene
or oil of turpentine is the commonest remedy.
Cleanliness of food, water and quarters is the great
preventive. Poultry men who keep their chicks
on ground not used for chick raising the previous
year, and who insist on strictest cleanliness, report
highly satisfactory results in avoiding gapes.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref100">GARGET.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A swelling, accompanied by inflammation
of the udder. It may be caused by kicks or
blows, by germs getting into the udder, or as a
result of holding the milk too long. Do not use
the milk when the udder is affected. For garget
rub with hot camphorated oil twice a day. Give as
medicine 8 tablespoonfuls of hyposulphite of soda
each day, either in the feed or in a drench. Keep
up the treatment for two weeks.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref101">GASTRITIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A rather uncommon disease in
domestic animals and the result of a disturbance in
the stomach, with inflammation following, caused
by irritating substances, usually of a poisonous
nature. A common symptom is nausea and pain like
colic. Indeed, the ordinary outward signs of colic are
observed. At first the pulse is strong, which weakens,
and runs rapidly, from 80 to 100 beats a minute.
As the disease progresses the pulse becomes irregular
and the animal dull and listless. Treatment
consists of simple agents. If the disturbance is
due to some potassium compound, give oil; if to
ammonia, give vinegar; if from turpentine, give
oil and opium, the opium in teaspoonful doses every
couple hours. After recovery, let only easily
digested food be provided.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref102">GID IN SHEEP.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A disease of the brain due to
a worm in the brain substance. This worm, known
as the bladder worm, is a form of the tape-worm
of the dog at an early stage of its existence. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
eggs of this worm, on being swallowed, are hatched
in the stomach, from which they enter into the
circulation, finally lodging in the brain and spinal
cord. Those that lodge elsewhere, as in the heart
and lungs, grow for a time and then disappear.
The most conspicuous symptom is the staggering,
stupefied condition of the affected animal.</p>

<p>In walking, if a single side is affected, a circle is
described. The feet are raised as if the animal did
not see well. In many cases blindness results.
The growth of the worm is somewhat rapid. In
about three weeks after the appearance of the
disease a softened condition of the skull results,
which may be found by pressing the fingers over
it. From this it will be observed that there is practically
no treatment for animals affected. Occasionally
the skin is accidentally broken over the
point where the worm is encysted, out of which it
emerges and the sheep recovers.</p>

<p>Treatment, therefore, is along the line of this
natural recovery. Find the soft spot by pressing
the fingers over the skull, then introduce the trocar
and canula. Withdraw the trocar, apply a syringe
to the canula, and withdraw the contents of
the cyst within. Of course, inflammation of the
brain may set in and the sheep die from this, or
another worm may be present and grow, thus causing
continued disease. Inasmuch as the bladder
worm of sheep is a stage of the tape-worm of the
dog, it follows that destroying all affected sheep,
so as to prevent the dogs from becoming reinfested
from it, is the only really safe and satisfactory
method of warding off the trouble.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref103">GLANDERS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A contagious disease peculiar to
the horse, ass, and mule, and may be communicated
to human beings, and also sometimes to carnivorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
animals in menageries, by means of infected horse
flesh, and also by means of inoculation to field mice,
guinea pigs, dogs, cats, goats, rabbits, and sheep.
Pigs are not readily susceptible and cattle appear
to be immune. Like all diseases of a contagious or
infectious character, glanders is due to a specific
organism, known as the bacillus malleus.</p>

<p>The external manifestations of glanders differ
and consequently the disease is spoken of as glanders
or farcy, depending upon the symptoms presented.
The disease is known as glanders when the
horse suffering from it has a discharge from the
nose, ulcers on the septum nasi (the partition dividing
the nasal cavities) and enlarged submaxillary
glands, and is known as farcy when the affected
animal has farcy &#8220;buds&#8221; or ulcers on the skin, and
corded lymphatic vessels running from one &#8220;bud&#8221;
to another. In farcy, the corded lymphatics, &#8220;buds&#8221;
and ulcers on the skin are very apt to be on the
inside of one hind leg or the other, but may appear
on the inside of a fore leg, or on the neck or body.</p>

<p>Farcy was, in olden times, thought to be a different
disease from glanders, and was believed by many
to be curable, while glanders has always been generally
believed to be incurable, but it is now known
that farcy is simply one manifestation of glanders.
It has been found that a horse with glanders may
give another farcy, and vice versa. Guinea pigs
inoculated with the discharge from a glandered
horse&#8217;s nose will develop glanders, and pure cultures
of the glanders bacillus can be obtained from
them, and in a similar way if guinea pigs are inoculated
with the discharge from a sore on a horse
with farcy glanders may be produced in these little
experimental animals, and upon post mortem examination
pure cultures of the glanders bacillus can<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
be obtained from the lesions of the disease produced
in them. Glanders and farcy may again be
divided into two forms, acute and chronic glanders,
and acute and chronic farcy.</p>

<p>In the acute form the disease develops rapidly,
the lesions form more speedily and with greater
rapidity than in the chronic form and the animal
loses strength and condition and dies within the
course of a few weeks, sometimes in the course of
a week or two. It is not unusual to meet with an
animal showing symptoms of both glanders and
farcy, especially in the acute form.</p>

<p>In the chronic form the symptoms are not so well
marked, and a horse may go for months keeping in
fairly good condition and able to do its work, the
disease developing very slowly, and at times showing
a tendency to recover; yet such an animal is a
source of danger to other horses, and also to the
man taking care of him or driving him. A horse
with chronic glanders, or farcy, may give the disease
to another in an acute form, especially if the
other one is more susceptible for some reason, such
as a less strong constitution or being run down by
hard work.</p>

<p>Post mortem examination of horses with glanders,
or farcy, nearly always reveals the presence
of glanders nodules or tubercles in the lungs, and,
in many instances, there is no doubt but what a
horse may have the tubercles of glanders in his
lungs for some time before showing outward symptoms
of the disease, and in many cases the primary
lesions of the infection occur in the lungs. A horse
with lung glanders may be a source of danger to
other horses and cause disease in them and yet go
unsuspected for some time. A case is said to have
occurred in Boston a number of years ago where a<span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span>
hack horse lost eight successive mates with glanders;
he was finally killed and his lungs were found
to be full of glanders nodules, and yet he never
showed any external symptoms of glanders. Such
cases could be cited in large numbers if space permitted,
but one example will answer.</p>

<div class="figcenter w440p" id="Fig37">
<img src="images/illo170.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="476" />
<p class="caption main">BAD CASE OF GLANDERS</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The farcy form is shown here. The animal has not long
to live. Except for experimental purposes, every horse having
glanders should be killed as soon as the disease is discovered.</p>
</div>

<p>A horse with lung glanders may have a little dry,
spasmodic cough, may look somewhat unthrifty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
and if the temperature were taken it might be
slightly above normal, say, 101 degrees to 101<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>,
the normal temperature being 100 degrees. Yet
such an animal might do its work, last for a long
time and not be suspected as a source of danger
until several cases had occurred in the stable, for
which it was difficult to account.</p>

<p>While a well-marked case of glanders or of farcy
is not difficult of diagnosis, there are many obscure
cases which escape detection for some time. If a
horse has a well-marked discharge from one or both
nostrils, with characteristic chancres visible upon
the mucous membrane of the septum nasi, and hard
enlarged submaxillary glands in the intermaxillary
space, it is not a difficult matter to diagnose such
a case, and any horseman ought to recognize it.
The same is true of a well-marked case of farcy.
When the lymphatic vessels on the inside of a leg,
especially a hind leg, are swelled and corded, with
a chain of farcy buds along their course, some of
which have gathered and broken, leaving a discharging
open ulcer in the skin, it is quite evident
that the animal is suffering from farcy.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of glanders seems to be a tendency
for the symptoms to appear on the left side; in
many cases of glanders the discharge and ulceration
is in the left nostril, and the left submaxillary
gland is enlarged; and in a large number of the cases
of farcy met with it is the left hind leg that shows
the lesions of the disease. In obscure cases of
glanders or farcy the diagnosis is not always so
easy, even for experts, and then other methods for
determining the trouble have to be resorted to.
These are the guinea pig test and the mallein test.
The guinea pig test consists of inoculating one or
two of these little animals with the discharge from<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
a suspected horse&#8217;s nose, or from a farcy sore. If
they should develop glanders it would be proof
positive that the suspected horse had this disease;
if they do not develop glanders it is not always positive
proof that the suspected horse is free from
the disease. Sometimes more than one test is
necessary, or another method of diagnosis may have
to be resorted to. This is the mallein test.</p>

<p>Mallein is a product made from cultures of the
glanders bacillus analogous to tuberculin as made
from cultures of the tubercle bacillus, and is used
for testing horses for glanders much as tuberculin
is used for testing cattle for tuberculosis. A horse
infected with glanders will react to a mallein test
in much the same way as a cow infected with tuberculosis
will react to the tuberculin test. It is not
customary in some states to kill a horse that reacts
to mallein unless it shows some clinical evidence of
disease. All horses that show clinical evidence of
glanders or farcy in some states are killed by the
state authority, and the law requires persons knowing
or suspecting cases of this kind to report in
writing to the chief of the cattle bureau of the
state board of agriculture or to the inspector of
animals in the city or town where the disease is
believed to exist, except in some cities where the
city board of health has full charge of glanders and
farcy. Anyone selling, removing, transporting, or
concealing a horse knowing or having reasonable
cause to believe it has glanders or farcy is in most
states liable to a heavy penalty.</p>

<p>In stables where glanders exists, in some cases,
all the horses are tested and divided; the reactors
are separated from the non-reactors, and those that
react are tested once a month until they cease to
react, or show physical indications of glanders and<span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
are killed. Used in this way mallein seems to have
a curative effect on incipient cases, and has been
very successfully used in freeing infected stables
from the disease. When a horse is killed because
it has glanders or farcy the stall should be thoroughly
disinfected where it has been kept, as well
as the harness, blankets, currycomb and other
utensils, and anything that cannot be easily disinfected
ought to be destroyed. Public watering
troughs where the horse has been watered should be
emptied and cleaned out, and the blacksmith ought
to disinfect his shop where the horse was shod.</p>

<p>There are various diseases that may be taken for
glanders or farcy, and there have also been numerous
instances where glanders has been taken for
something else; for instance, chronic nasal catarrh.
What many old-time veterinarians used to call
chronic nasal catarrh or nasal gleet, were, in many
instances, if not in nearly all, cases of chronic
glanders, and when one of these cases of nasal
gleet was rounded up in a locality, glanders disappeared
in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>A horse with a chronic discharge from the nose
as the result of a decayed tooth may sometimes be
mistaken for a case of glanders, and also a horse
with distemper or strangles; but the latter generally
recovers soon, and in strangles the gland under the
jaw softens and breaks and discharges while in
glanders the gland remains firm and hard and generally
not sensitive to manipulation.</p>

<p>There is a disease that has been troublesome in
Pennsylvania and parts of Ohio the last two years
called suppurative lymphangitis or epizootic lymphangitis,
which may be mistaken for farcy, but
animals suffering from it do not react to mallein,
and guinea pigs inoculated with the discharges do<span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span>
not develop glanders. There is not much glanders
in the Eastern states, except in the cities, and the
disease is not of a great deal of interest to farmers,
except to avoid purchasing animals with it at some
of the unreliable sales stables. Where a case occurs
on a farm, except on some market gardener&#8217;s
farm near a city, it is found, as a rule, that the horse
was purchased at some unscrupulous dealer&#8217;s stable
in the city, and, in some instances, other horses on
the farm are infected, and the farmer not only loses
his new acquisition, but has two or three other
horses killed besides that have become infected.</p>

<p>Farmers buying new horses at city sales stables
ought to endeavor to deal with only reputable concerns,
and to avoid cheats. It is well to remember
that a person cannot get something for nothing,
and it is not likely that anyone can buy a horse for
$50 to $75 because it is afraid of elevated railroad
trains that would otherwise be worth $300 to $500,
or because a widow lady wants a good home for her
late husband&#8217;s old pet. Anyone buying horses
from a fake coal company, or a humbug ice company,
or an unknown express company that is just
going out of business, is liable to invite a serious
disease to his farm.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref104">GRAVEL OR DIRT IN FOOT.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A collection
of pus, or other fluid containing gravel or
dirt. It occurs most frequently in the foot,
and is associated with the horse and mule
almost exclusively. The cause may be from a
bruise, but more frequently it is due to a punctured
wound of the foot by nail, wire, or other
pointed object. Nearly always there will be dirt
carried into the wound with the offending object or
shortly after its removal. This dirt, infected with
germs, sets up an inflammation of the sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
structures causing more or less lameness. In many
instances the nail hole becomes closed up and the
collected matter may have to seek an outlet above
the hoof. To determine the trouble a very careful
examination of the hoof should be made, looking
for any opening leading into the foot, often detected
by discoloration of the part, or at an over-sensitive
point in the foot.</p>

<p>Treatment should consist in making or enlarging
the opening at a dependent part of the hoof, if
possible, so that all secretion formed in the wound
can find a ready escape to the outside. Without
free opening there is danger of tetanus (lockjaw)
developing. The wound should be thoroughly
cleansed, and washed with some mild disinfectant,
after which a small quantity of oil of turpentine
should be injected, and the wound packed with
calomel or iodoform and covered with a pledget
of cotton. If the wound is very deep or extensive
it may be beneficial, after thoroughly cleansing the
foot, to apply a hot bran or flaxseed poultice. Use
poultice for several days and change daily.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref105">GREASE HEEL.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A form of eczema that attacks
the skin of the heel and fetlock. Sometimes
the disease becomes so severe as to crack open, from
which blood oozes out. A crust forms and later
on becomes painful and disagreeable. To remove
the scurvy part that is noticed first, apply a poultice,
made of wheat bran or linseed meal. Change
the poultices two or three times during the day.
After removal each time wash with warm water, in
which has been put some carbolic acid or creolin, and
then apply the poultice again. After the poulticing
is ended apply a salve made of 4 tablespoonfuls of
oxide of zinc and 8 tablespoonfuls of vaseline. If
indigestion seems to be associated in any way, give<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
the horse a dose of physic, aloes being best for the
purpose.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref106">GRUB IN THE HEAD.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This condition is the
presence of the larva (worm stage) of the sheep bot
fly, located in the frontal sinuses (cavities) of the
head. The trouble is confined to sheep and occasionally
goats. The so-called &#8220;grub&#8221; of the horse
is found in its stomach, while the &#8220;grub&#8221; of cattle
is found along its back just underneath the skin.
The adult fly, which lays the living &#8220;sheep grub,&#8221;
is of a yellowish-gray color, slightly larger than a
house fly. During the warmer part of the summer
days the fly goes about depositing its young in the
nose of the sheep. The young then work their way
upward into cavities of the head between the eyes,
but not into the brain cavity. Here they attach
themselves to the lining, remaining when unmolested
for some ten months, then lose their hold
and are sneezed out to the ground. Burrowing
into the ground they enter the pupa or dormant
stage, when, after a month or six weeks, they
emerge as adult flies to replenish their kind.</p>

<p>When few grubs are in the head little trouble may
be observed, but if more numerous may cause free
discharge of dirty white or yellowish, thick fluid, loss
of appetite, frequent coughing and sneezing, tossing
of head and weakened gait, and the animal may become
too weak to rise, and finally dies. With a special
instrument (trephine) bore a hole into the cavity
containing grubs and remove them with forceps.
When they are present every year the sheep should
be protected by keeping the nose smeared with
tar during summer months. This can be done by
causing sheep to lick salt from holes in a trough
after placing tar about the holes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span></p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref107">HAIR BALLS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;True hair balls are seldom
found in other animals than cattle, resulting either
from licking themselves or others; but different
kinds of indigestible balls or concretions are frequently
found in cattle and other animals, particularly
the horse, in the stomach or intestines. Dust
balls are occasionally formed when animals are fed
upon mill cleanings. In sections where crimson
clover is fed, and frequently in over-ripe condition
in large quantities, balls are formed of parts of the
indigestible heads. Again, calcareous or mineral
matter may accumulate about an indigestible substance
as a nucleus. These are not well-defined,
in many instances, and the balls are often present
without making it known. So long as they do not
irritate the bowel too much, or do not occlude the
opening from one portion of the bowel to another,
they are likely to escape notice. In case they do
obstruct the bowel they become serious obstacles,
the greater number of these cases terminating in
death. The symptoms then become those of colic
from obstruction. In many cases no relief can be
given, but attempts should be made to cause the
obstruction to pass by giving mild purgatives and
copious enemas.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref108">HEAVES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The term &#8220;heaves&#8221; is used to describe
that disease of the horse which otherwise is
known as &#8220;broken wind,&#8221; or technically as &#8220;emphysema
of the lungs.&#8221; This ailment, which is incurable
when thoroughly established and to which a tendency
is inherited by the offspring of an affected
sire or dam, is characterized by the following symptoms:
Double, bellows-like action of the abdominal
muscles in breathing; short, suppressed cough,
usually accompanied by passage of gas from the
rectum; gluttonous appetite; harsh, staring coat<span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span>
of hair; pot belly; weakness; lack of endurance,
sweating, panting, or staggering during work;
dilated nostrils; frequent passage of gas and soft,
foul-smelling feces when starting from stable.</p>

<p>The disease begins with indigestion, affecting in
time the pneumo-gastric nerve of the stomach and
then the branch nerves running to the lungs. At
first the air tubules and vesicles of the lungs become
dilated (aneurism); later they may break
down into large air spaces and the surrounding
lung tissues become involved (interlobular emphysema).
Air then is easily inhaled, but is exhaled
with difficulty and the effort causes cough
and expulsion of gas (flatus).</p>

<p>The distress may be relieved by treatment, but
perfect recovery is impossible when the lungs have
become badly affected. Treat by substituting wet
oat straw for hay in winter and grass for hay in
summer. Allow double the usual rest period after
a meal. Work when stomach is not distended with
food. Do not feed hay at noon. Use lime water
to wet all food. Once or twice a week give raw
linseed oil in a bran mash to open bowels. Give
half an ounce of Fowler&#8217;s solution of arsenic night
and morning. Do not breed from affected horses.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref109">HEAT EXHAUSTION AND SUNSTROKE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The
horse that is stricken with heat exhaustion or
which falls from heat, apoplexy or &#8220;sunstroke,&#8221; is
sick or out of sorts at the time of attack; otherwise
he would withstand heat and work. The middle
horse of a three-horse team suffers most and is apt
to succumb to the ill-effects of the combined radiation
of heat from his mates and direct rays of the
sun. Attacks are most apt to happen on the third or
fourth day of a spell of intensely hot weather characterized
by mugginess, electrical storms and moisture-saturated<span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span>
air. At such times the horse that
has indigestion, a heavy, unhealthy coat of hair, a
skin or kidney trouble or any affection of the brain
or heart is the one that must be most carefully
watched and worked.</p>

<p>With the hope of preventing attacks feed light
rations, no corn, no mashes, no ground feed other
than bran; avoid green grass, unless the horses are
on it all of the time; do not feed hay at noon; allow
cool, pure drinking water often when horses are at
work; keep stables clean, darkened, screened, and
ventilated; shade the polls of the horses&#8217; heads
during work time and in such a way that air passes
freely under the shading device.</p>

<p>In sunstroke the horse falls and soon succumbs.
In heat exhaustion he lags, stops sweating, pants,
staggers, skin is dry, nostrils dilated, membranes
of eyes and nostrils red. High fever is present.
Treat by keeping cold, wet packs to the poll of
head or letting a stream of cold water run over it.
Shower body with cold water from a sprinkling
can. Stand horse in shady place under a tree
where air passes. Give stimulants freely in water
as a drench every hour at first, then less often as
symptoms abate. A suitable stimulant is whiskey
in half pint doses, or a mixture of one part of
aromatic spirits of ammonia and two parts each of
alcohol and sweet spirits of niter. Dose is two
ounces in half pint water. Do not bleed horse or
give aconite. Give half ounce doses of saltpeter in
water twice daily as horse recovers. Call the
veterinarian in sunstroke cases.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref110">HERNIA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A protrusion of any portion of the
bowels or their coverings through a break in the
walls of the abdomen. A rupture, for that is the
popular term, is most common in horses. Often<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
at birth they are seen near the navel. These disappear
in a few months without any treatment
being required. In mature horses the usual causes
are blows, kicks or some violent effort that tears
the muscular structure.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500p" id="Fig38">
<img src="images/illo180.png" alt="" width="500" height="392" />
<p class="caption main">VENTRAL HERNIA</p>
<p class="caption subshort">It may occur in any part of the abdomen and varies in size
with the extent of the rupture.</p>
</div>

<p>The characteristic symptom is the bulging out of
the gut, tumorlike; and this often can be slipped
back where it belongs. If the rent be not closed,
even if the gut is returned, the least bit of strain
is liable to force it out again. Some kinds of
hernia cause immense pain and the animal shows it.</p>

<p>In treating, work the gut back to its place. This
done, place a pad&mdash;a flat piece of wood or leather
will do&mdash;over the wound and fasten in such a way
as to keep it in place. This should be worn for a
month until recovery is complete. Such treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
will not serve in all cases of hernia. An operation
may be necessary, which should be made only by a
skillful veterinarian.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref111">HIDE-BOUND.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This is not a disease at all, but
an indication of poor health, more particularly of
poor nutrition; usually the result of indigestion, improper
food, worms or want of proper exercise.
The skin is hard, rough, papery, and cannot be
picked up from the body with ease. When the
attempt is made, it suggests that the body is too
large for the skin. Of course treatment is in the
nature of better food, that proper nourishment may
be secured. A good physic will be proper to start
with and then follow with a tonic, easily assimilable
food of a nature that will properly nourish the
body.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref112">HIGH BLOWING.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A sound produced in the
act of breathing while the air is being expelled from
the lungs during forced respiration. It is a fluttering
sort of a sound. When horses are trotting or pacing
the sound is essentially a nasal one, and is not
to be regarded as a state of unsoundness. It is
rather a measure of excitability, and associated with
horses of much spirit and good breeding.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref113">HIP JOINT LAMENESS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A disease of the hip,
caused usually by some injury as from a fall or
kick. A slight swelling is observed just over the
hip, and lameness when the animal walks or trots.
In severe cases, the horse will hop and catch the
lame leg. The best treatment is absolute rest.
Frequent applications of hot water are good. After
each application bathe with a solution made of 4
ounces of water, 2 ounces of tincture of opium, 2
ounces of tincture of arnica and an ounce of belladonna.
If the lameness continues, use a blister<span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
made of 2 teaspoonfuls of cantharides and 4 tablespoonfuls
of lard. Allow the blister to remain for
an entire day, then wash off with soap and water
and apply lard or vaseline. Repeat in a couple of
weeks if necessary. If the lameness disappears,
give the horse rest for several weeks.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref114">HIPPED.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A fracture at the point of the hip. The
most common cause is striking the point of the hip
against a door post or pole. Sometimes a kick is
responsible. While recovery follows, as a rule,
from the very nature of the fracture, there is no
treatment that will remedy the broken point. After
the soreness has passed no inconvenience results;
only a blemish is observed.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref115">HOG CHOLERA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The term hog cholera has
become quite ambiguous, partly on account of new
discoveries concerning the cause of the disease and
partly on account of what have been supposed to
be two different but curiously related diseases
being generally included under this general term.
Until within a year or two we have supposed that
there were two infectious diseases of hogs recognized
under the general terms of hog cholera and
swine plague. It now seems probable that we will
be able to do away with the term swine plague
entirely.</p>

<p>The disease considered here answers to the following
requirements: (a) Infectious by association
or other natural exposure; (b) the animal
before death and the carcass after death show certain
accepted symptoms which are clearly recognized
as pertaining to cholera; (c) the blood is
virulent and capable of reproducing the disease on
inoculation into susceptible hogs; (d) attack and
recovery confer immunity. It is to be understood
that we might easily have diseases among swine<span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span>
where characteristic &#8220;a&#8221; or even &#8220;b&#8221; might be
present and yet the disease be not true hog cholera.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500p" id="Fig39">
<img src="images/illo183.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" />
<p class="caption main">AN ATTACK OF CHOLERA</p>
<p class="caption subshort">One of the familiar attitudes assumed when the hog is
affected with cholera. When this far along, not many cases
of recovery are observed.</p>
</div>

<p>Until within recent years American authorities,
bacteriologists and veterinarians alike, have very
generally accepted a certain germ, the bacillus of
Salmon and Smith, as the specific cause of hog
cholera and another somewhat similar germ as the
cause of what was supposed to be a distinct but
curiously related disease&mdash;swine plague. But
within a few years workers in the Federal bureau
of animal industry have apparently demonstrated
that hog cholera is caused by a living germ so small
that it passes easily through germ filters which remove
all known forms of the bacillus of Salmon
and Smith.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note further that this
new germ is so small as to be invisible to the
highest available powers of the best microscope.
That it is a living organism and not a chemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
poison may be very easily demonstrated. The
curious relations to this disease of the old bacilli
of hog cholera and of swine plague are not well
understood, but it seems quite possible that they
may play some part in the later development of
the disease after the disease processes have been
started by the invisible germ. While our old
theories and supposed information concerning the
cause of hog cholera have been very much disturbed
by newer work, it is important to remember
that hog cholera is now just as much as before to
be recognized as a distinctly infectious disease. It
is important to remember also that this infection
is absolutely necessary, or there can be no cholera
no matter how susceptible animals may be.
There can be no cholera without this primary and
specific cause any more than there can be plants
in our wheat fields without the previous presence
of mustard seed. Conditions of soil and climate
may favor a rank growth of mustard. Conditions
of feed and keep may favor the development and
spread of hog cholera. They may decrease resistance
and increase susceptibility, but cannot originally
cause the disease. It is a rather common experience
that hogs kept closely housed and fed,
especially with such foods as corn, offer less resistance
than do other hogs. In our vaccine work we
frequently find hogs of this type which die readily
under inoculation with blood of low grade virulence.
Hogs of hardier type may become slightly sick or
not sick at all with inoculation from the same infectious
material. Pampered show herds appear
especially susceptible to both natural infection and
artificial inoculation.</p>

<p>The farmer, and for that matter the public in
general, should bear in mind that the cause of hog<span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span>
cholera is a living organism capable of enormously
rapid self-multiplication&mdash;actual, though very minute
particles of matter. This, fully understood, makes it
apparent that infection may be carried in any way
that other fine particles of matter may be carried.
It thus becomes very apparent that the infection
may be carried by sick hogs or upon the legs and
bodies of hogs not sick; it may be carried in wagon
boxes, in hog racks, in stock cars, or upon shoes
and clothing of people. It is very evident that the
infection may be carried down stream, especially
in small creeks, and give rise to other outbreaks.</p>

<p>So far as the sick hog is concerned, we are quite
sure that the blood and the manure are thoroughly
infectious and there can be no question concerning
the infectiousness of fresh carcasses of dead hogs.
Perhaps we should say first of all that we rarely
get all of the accepted symptoms of hog cholera
plainly shown in one case. It is important to bear
in mind that cases vary in virulence from those of
very chronic type where hogs live for weeks and
finally die or recover, to very acute cases where
they die overnight.</p>

<p>The hog coming down with cholera is usually
sluggish at first, lying around in the shade and refusing
feed. The hair may become rough. The
eyes early show symptoms of inflammation, with a
sticky discharge. There is usually a suppressed
cough. The gait may become irregular and uncertain,
especially with the hind legs. After these
preliminary symptoms have been shown for a time,
the skin becomes red, changing to purple, especially
noticeable in white-haired hogs. The hog is then
usually within a very few days of death.</p>

<p>As already explained, not all cases are typical.
Sometimes hogs die in an outbreak of cholera from<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
undoubted hog cholera, and yet the ante mortem
or post mortem symptoms show very little upon
which to base a diagnosis. But we may easily
demonstrate that these were cases of cholera by
injecting their
blood into susceptible
hogs
and by thus
producing typical
cholera.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350p" id="Fig40">
<img src="images/illo186.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="586" />
<p class="caption main">THE RESULT OF HOG CHOLERA</p>
<p class="caption sublong">A post mortem of a hog dying from
cholera will show ulcers like those pictured
here. Look for them in the large
intestine.</p>
</div>

<p>At the autopsy
of an ordinary
case of cholera
the first and
perhaps the
most striking
thing seen is the
purpling of the
skin. On opening
the carcass small
blood spots may
be found under
the skin and in
the fat cut
through. The
glands along the
intestines are
intensely inflamed. The
mucous membrane
of the
stomach is frequently thickened and roughened
and in chronic cases there may be ulcers.
On opening the intestines we see areas here and
there of intense inflammation in the acute cases or
numerous ulcers in cases of more chronic type. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
very acute cases we find areas intensely inflamed,
even bloody in places. The slow chronic cases
develop characteristic hog cholera ulcers. These
may appear at almost any point on the lining membrane,
but more particularly in the blind pouch and
around the point where the small intestine connects
with the large intestine. On stripping off a very
thin transparent membrane covering the kidneys,
a typical case of hog cholera will usually show
minute red spots on the surface somewhat resembling
the covering of a turkey egg, which gives the
common name of turkey egg kidney of hog cholera.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref116">Preventing the Disease.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Clearly there are certain
things which the owner of healthy hogs in a
hog cholera district should do and a good many
things which he should not do. The same is equally
true for the man who has sick hogs in a neighborhood
where there are uninfected herds. The owner
of healthy hogs and his family should keep away
from public stock yards, from all pens and yards
on other farms whether sickness among hogs prevails
or not. It may easily occur that a neighbor&#8217;s
hogs may appear well but have recently received
the infection and be already capable of scattering
the disease. We do not know at what period in
the development of this disease infected hogs become
capable of disseminating hog cholera.</p>

<p>During a hog cholera season the owner of healthy
hogs should institute something in the way of private
quarantine and pleasantly, perhaps, but firmly,
ask visitors, especially stock buyers and threshing
machine crews, to keep at a reasonable distance
from the pens and yards. It is safer for one man
to have exclusive care of healthy hogs during the
hog cholera season, and this man should be very
careful where he goes with reference to possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span>
infection. Special fencing or other provisions
should be made wherever practical to keep dogs out
of the pens and yards, for, under certain conditions,
dogs become very active agents in spreading the
disease.</p>

<p>The owner of a healthy herd should be very careful
about buying in hogs for feeding or breeding
purposes, and, in the Western states especially, all
public stock yards and stock cars must be regarded
as possible sources of spread. Hogs coming into
the herd for breeding purposes, if by rail, should be
shipped in other than stock cars, and should not be
unloaded so as to go through stock yards. All new
hogs coming on to a farm where the disease has not
appeared, should be kept carefully apart from the
herd for from two to three weeks after arrival.
The disease may thus have time to develop, if the
animals have been infected before shipment or en
route. It is decidedly worth while to be careful
about clean feeding, for it seems probable that this
is a common method by which infection enters the
body. This being the case, troughs and feeding
floors should be frequently disinfected with steam,
boiling water, or a very dilute corrosive sublimate
solution (1:1,000 dissolved in water), with the
troughs subsequently rinsed out with plain water.
Or the troughs and feeding floors may be disinfected
with any of the coal tar disinfectants if they
are used in sufficient strength. These are not
poisonous in any probable quantity which hogs
would get.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref117">A Disastrous Experience.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The farmer should be
especially careful about buying hogs out of stock
yards. Some years ago a certain Minnesota
farmer purchased a lot of feeders from Sioux City
and took them home to his farm. In about two<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
weeks his hogs commenced dying. A little later
hogs previously on the farm began dying. In a
little while he was losing hogs at the rate of 25 a
day, losing a total of about 200. This loss of 200
hogs was scarcely a drop in the bucket&mdash;too small
for consideration in comparison with the loss which
this outbreak cost the state, for, with some others
coming into the state from Iowa and Nebraska,
this outbreak cost the state, as carefully estimated,
about $1,250,000 during that one year. As soon
as the Minnesota farmer here referred to realized
that he had cholera and was liable to lose a large
portion of his herd, he shipped out a lot of fat hogs
ready for market. These were yarded for a time in
the public stock yards of his town, and one of them
died while waiting for shipment. This hog was
left for a day or so in the yard. Later a carload
of feeding hogs was shipped in from a point in
South Dakota, where they had never had hog
cholera. These South Dakota hogs were unloaded
into the yards where the fat hog had died some
time before, and were sold out from there by
auction.</p>

<p>It was a very interesting study to follow the
resulting outbreaks; but a very serious matter for
the owner and for that entire portion of the state.
Practically every farmer who bought hogs at this
sale, and very many of those who walked around
the yards looking at the hogs, but without buying,
had hog cholera on their farms in a very uniform
period after the sale. Surely the moral of this tale
is so self-evident as to need no further suggestion.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref118">Cleaning Up.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Troughs and feeding floors, at
least, and, if practicable, the hog house also, should
be kept clean and frequently disinfected during an
outbreak. When the outbreak appears to be over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>
the owner must decide as to just what he will do in
the way of disinfection and cleaning up, or whether
he will stay out of the hog business for a year and
allow the infection to die out. This is, of course,
without regard for the possibility of putting in
vaccinated and immune hogs. Feeding troughs and
feeding floors and the hog house in general, may be
disinfected if of reasonably good construction, by a
thorough cleaning and then by one of the methods
suggested under prevention. If the sick hogs have
been kept in an old straw shed or in an old hog
house that is about ready to fall down anyway, by
all means the best method of disinfection is by
burning. Without disinfection or burning the
owner cannot be safe in putting in susceptible hogs
within much less than a year after the last hog died
or recovered. The slow old chronic cases that go
dragging around at the end of an outbreak should
usually be killed and safely buried, for it is rarely
profitable to put such hogs in shape for market.
It might possibly be worth while to hold such a
one over and nurse them along, in case of valuable
brood sows, for hogs having recovered from cholera
are usually immune for life.</p>

<p>Brood sows which have had the disease and recovered
usually give something more than natural
immunity to their offspring. But the degree of
immunity so conferred is so variable in degree and
uncertain otherwise that it cannot be depended
upon as a routine method of establishing immune
herds. Yards may be practically disinfected by
plowing or by burning off a good layer of straw.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref119">Hog Cholera Vaccination.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Generally stated, this
vaccine consists of two parts: (a) Blood serum
from the body of a specially immunized hog; and
(b) virulent blood serum from the body of a hog<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
about to die from cholera. The general theory
upon which this double vaccine is used is that of
giving the animal an infectious disease and at the
same time a treatment which enables the animal to
resist the infection. When the hog is through with
it he is in exactly the same condition as though he
had gone through a natural exposure and recovered.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref120">General Method.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;We start this work with certain
hogs that are immune usually because they
have passed through an outbreak. It has been
shown that when such immune hogs are treated
with large injections of virulent blood under the
skin or into a vein, that they do not usually become
sick, but their own blood develops a peculiar property
that gives protection to other hogs that are
naturally susceptible.</p>

<p>When the blood or rather blood serum from this
specially treated immune hog is injected into the
bodies of healthy susceptible hogs, the latter becomes
likewise immune, but the immunity so gained
lasts only a short time, possibly four to six weeks,
and is then gradually lost. If we give a small injection
of virulent blood at the same time, or soon
after the immunizing serum is given, then the
treated hog becomes immune for a long period, perhaps
for life.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref121">The Serum Hog.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The specially immunized hog
which produces this immunizing serum is known as
a hyperimmune, and to save words will be hereafter
mentioned as such. The simply immune hog may
be prepared for producing serum in either one of
three ways. (1) By three rapidly increasing doses
of virulent blood serum injected under the skin at
intervals of seven to ten days; (2) by one enormously
large injection of virulent serum under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
skin; (3) by injecting virulent blood in smaller
doses directly into the blood circulation.</p>

<p>In this work an ordinary immune hog weighing
100 pounds is given a quart of very virulent blood,
a teaspoon of which similarly injected would kill
a hog that was not immune. In other words the
immune, and especially the hyperimmune hog, have
developed certain properties in their blood antagonistic
to hog cholera virus.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref122">Vaccination.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;We have two possible methods of
vaccinating or immunizing susceptible hogs (a)
Serum only. This is by the injection under the
skin of serum from the body of a hyperimmune hog
and gives immediate but temporary immunity lasting,
as already stated, several weeks. If this animal,
during the period of immunity, is exposed to
natural infection, he becomes protected for a very
long period, perhaps for life. (b) Simultaneous.
The second method of vaccination consists of injecting
immunizing blood serum into one thigh and
a small amount of disease-producing serum at the
same time, or soon after, into the other thigh, thus
giving the animal the cholera and a cure for it at
the same time. If the immunizing serum is potent
and the virulent serum is really virulent, then the
animal so treated becomes permanently immune.</p>

<p>The serum-only method is usually preferred in
actual outbreaks and for hogs not yet sick, because
this gives immediate protection, and the hogs, being
naturally exposed, usually develop a permanent immunity.
The simultaneous method of vaccination
is preferred where we are very confident of the
serum&#8217;s potency against the virulent blood, and for
hogs that have not yet been infected. It may yet
be found wise to use this method even in outbreaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref123">Vaccination Does Not Spread Cholera.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Every intelligent
stockman who reads this will probably ask
if there is not danger of scattering cholera by this
simultaneous vaccination into districts where it
has not yet appeared. A considerable amount of
direct evidence on this point is better than any
amount of theorizing and personal opinions. This
evidence all agrees that unless the vaccinated hogs
become distinctly sick as a result of the vaccination
(which can occur, and does very often), that
there is practically no danger of disseminating the
disease. This is especially true since all hogs on
the farm are supposed to have been treated and are
immune, and, therefore, incapable of developing
cholera and so spreading the disease. It does occur,
even with good serum, perhaps, that an occasional
hog may become a little sick, and very rarely even
die, as a result of vaccination. But with good serum
given in standard dose and virulent blood also given
in proper dose, the risk of this is so small that it
may be safely disregarded and especially when all
hogs on the farm or that may be exposed with such
sick hogs have been treated.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref124">HOLLOW HORN.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A common term to denote a
diseased condition of the blood. The horn is not
hollow and never is. The old quack method of
boring a hole in the horn with a gimlet and squirting
turpentine into the orifice is both cruel and
ridiculous. While in fact the temperature of the
horn is low, it is because of the general poverty
of the blood of the animal. There is no merit in
this kind of treatment. The most common symptoms
are general debility, scanty flesh, scurvy coat
and coarse hair. The appetite is also irregular and
at times greedy. Treatment is in line of better
food and general improvement of the system. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span>
lice are found on the body, they must be destroyed
by disinfectants and washes. A tonic, consisting
of 2 teaspoonfuls of sulphate of iron, 1 teaspoonful
of powdered nux vomica and 4 tablespoonfuls of
ground gentian root given each day in the food
or as a drench, will be very helpful in toning up the
system and in enriching the blood. The most
important factor of the treatment, however, is in
nutritious, wholesome food.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref191">Sand Cracks</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref126">HORN FLY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A small insect about half as large
as the common house flies, and very much like them
in appearance. Horn flies swarm about the head
and settle near the base of the horn, where they
bite and cause much irritation. They also attack
cattle on the back and sides and flank. The fly
mixtures that are commonly advertised, and applied
by means of a hand-spray, are excellent for
keeping the pests away. A good home mixture to
apply at the base of the horns is made of pine tar,
kerosene, and fish oil. Use this in equal parts, and
apply with a brush.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref129">HYDROPHOBIA</h3>

<p class="noindent">, also called rabies and mad
dog, is an infectious disease caused by some invisible
organism. The disease is transmitted from one
animal to another by the bite of an animal which is
suffering with the disease or by direct inoculation.
It is more common in the dog than any other
animal, from the fact that dogs run at large and
have a tendency to bite other dogs with which
they come in contact while they are suffering with
the disease.</p>

<p>The dog shows two forms, furious and dumb. In
the furious form the animal at first seeks dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
places, but is usually restless and will move from
one place to another. This condition lasts for a
day or two, after which time he becomes more restless
and may go 30 miles in a day. He will drink
water, eat sticks, stones, and bite other dogs,
horses, and cattle, less often man. This condition
will last from one to four days, and then the dog
becomes partly paralyzed, so that he can no longer
swallow, or his legs may be affected, so that he will
lie in one place, and usually dies after a few days
longer. In the dumb form, the animal seeks dark
places, is rather restless, the throat and lower jaw
become paralyzed, he is unable to swallow or to
close his mouth and, therefore, cannot bite. Sometimes
they will change from one form of symptoms
to the other.</p>

<p>In the horse the symptoms vary somewhat from
those in the dog. The horse is restless, usually
violent and will kick and bite, oftentimes showing
sexual excitement. He may break his teeth on the
manger and oftentimes bites his own flesh at the
place where he has been bitten by the dog. The
symptoms usually develop in from eight to twenty-eight
days after the animal is bitten, but may not
develop for six months. The disease runs its course
in from two to ten days, with a fatal termination.</p>

<p>There is no treatment for the disease after the
symptoms have developed. In case man is bitten
he should take the &#8220;Pasteur&#8221; treatment, which is
a preventive, and it should be taken in a very
short time after being bitten. After the symptoms
begin to show it is too late to take treatment.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref131">IMPACTION OF RUMEN.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A continued
distention of the rumen caused by large quantities
of undigested material lodging in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span>
rumen. Inflammation often results, with distress
and pain manifest. If relief is not attained
the walls of the rumen become paralyzed.
Associated with the disturbances the animal
is dull, the left side swollen, the breathing and pulse
increase and the back aches. When lying down,
the left side is always up. In treating, cold water
dashed over the back and loins is recommended. A
strong physic of Epsom salts and ginger will aid
in stimulating the secretions and may bring relief.
If gas accumulates so as to threaten the life of the
animal, the trocar and canula should be used. If
these are not available, use the knife, as described
for hoven or bloat. In some cases the impaction
becomes so pronounced as to resist ordinary treatment,
when extreme measures will be necessary if
the animal is to be saved. Better call your veterinarian
and open the rumen in order to remove the
contents with the hand. The operation is as follows:
At the point midway between the point of
the hip and the last rib, and down about four inches
from the backbone, an opening is made large
enough to admit the hand. After the opening is
made the edges are stitched to prevent any material
from getting between the skin and the rumen wall.
Now remove the greater part of the accumulated
material; this done, the rumen, the muscles and
the skin are each in turn stitched, the wound
dressed and the animal given stimulating medicines.
A splendid tonic consists of 4 tablespoonfuls each
of ginger, tincture of gentian and tincture of iron.
Give this tonic daily and until the animal has fully
recovered.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref132">INDIGESTION.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Failure to digest food with
abdominal pains and indisposition resulting. Bad
food and improper management are back of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
trouble in most instances. Mild cases require no
treatment. A light, laxative diet is desirable for stubborn
cases. If possible turn the animals on fresh
grass. Jamaica ginger is generally prescribed for
indigestion. Give 8 tablespoonfuls in a pint of
warm water three times a day as a drench. Follow
this with condition powders, or some good digestive
tonic. After recovery see that the diet is varied
and that laxative and succulent foods are supplied.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref133">INFECTIOUS PNEUMONIA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;As the name indicates,
this is an infectious trouble frequently extending
over considerable areas and occurs among
both horses and cattle. It is very similar in its action
to ordinary pneumonia or inflammation of the
lungs. However, it does not seem to be so acute
in its action. The same treatment is applied to
cases of this kind as to ordinary pneumonia. When
its presence becomes known, it is wise to remove
all healthy animals to some other quarters. This
lessens the danger of infection to healthy animals.
After the disease has run its course, remove all
litter and manure from the stables, thoroughly air
out, admit as much sunlight as possible, and disinfect
all walls and floors. A coat of whitewash on
the ceiling and walls is desirable. The floors
should be literally wet with disinfectant fluid, which
should be admitted to all cracks and open spaces.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref134">INFECTIOUS ANEMIA IN HORSES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See
<a href="#Ref208">Swamp Fever</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref135">INFLAMMATION OF THE BOWELS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Sometimes
this disease is called enteritis. It frequently
follows severe cases of colic. It is the result
of inflammation caused by indigestible material
lodging in the stomach and intestines of animals. It
may, however, result from other things that irritate
the bowels. When first noticed, a general depression<span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span>
prevails, with signs of pain in the bowels; breathing
is quickened and frequently a chill shows itself.
The horse acts very much as if he had a case of
colic. As the disease progresses the pain increases
and the pulse rises. In a few hours the pain becomes
very severe and the animal is in great agony
all over; he breathes heavy, the legs and ears are
cold and clammy and the pulse very high. In
severe cases the pulse reaches to 100 and 105 beats
a minute. The horse now is very ill indeed. He
shows great weakness. It is very unlikely that he
will survive more than a day or two. The disease
usually runs from ten to fifteen hours, and unless
there is a change for the better, death results.</p>

<p>When far advanced there is little likelihood of
successful treatment. Success lies only in early
work, taking the disease in time. A satisfactory
drench is made of 4 tablespoonfuls of tincture of
laudanum, 10 to 15 drops of tincture of aconite, 1
tablespoonful of common soda, and 1 tablespoonful
of ginger. These are mixed in a pint of warm water
and given as a drench. Repeat this every hour
until the animal gets relief. A mustard plaster
gives relief when applied to the belly. A physic
is not considered advisable, as it increases the inflammation&mdash;just
what is not wanted at all.</p>

<p>The most rational treatment consists in allaying
the pain. Opium in teaspoonful doses every hour
until the pain is relieved is helpful. Some veterinary
practitioners use 10 grains of morphia and 4
tablespoonfuls of chloral hydrate in syrup and
water for each dose. This dose is repeated every
two or three hours until the symptoms abate.</p>

<p>The diet should be carefully watched in diseases
of this kind. Bran mashes made with linseed tea
or slippery elm bark are suitable. Boiled food is<span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span>
better than uncooked food. Good water frequently
and in small quantities is desirable. Skimmed milk
is excellent and may be fed for a week or two at a
time. This food often effects a cure without any
other aid.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref136">INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This is
a common disease in farm stock. The disease occurs
most frequently in late fall or winter or early spring,
and is due to exposure while the animal is still warm
and hot; bad ventilation influences it. Authorities
now generally believe it to be a germ disease
and infectious. One of the first things noticed is
the shivering of the animal and then a fevered condition;
the animal seems to be hot, then cold; a
peculiar breathing is noticed; the pulse quickens,
ranges from 60 to 70 beats a minute; the eyelids
on the inside take a scarlet hue. The animal does
not eat, stands up much of the time with the head
down and the ears lopped over; a grating sound is
noticed when the ear is placed to the chest. Frequently
distress is experienced in the bowels; constipation
follows and the temperature rises gradually
until it reaches 105 degrees, which is reached
about the sixth or seventh day. If recovery does
not follow the appetite will disappear, the mouth
become cold, the breath heavy and disagreeable
and the pulse feeble, frequently not noticeable at
all.</p>

<p>After the case assumes a more favorable aspect,
an effort should be made to keep the animal comfortable
and in as good condition as possible. It is
therefore advisable to keep it well blanketed, the
legs bandaged and rubbed. The patient should be
kept also in a warm stall where good air is available.
Good food that is nourishing and easily
digested should be provided. Sweet milk is good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span>
and raw eggs mixed in the gruel are excellent also.
A compress over the lungs does much good. The
compress should be made out of heavy cloth, frequently
rinsed in cold water and then placed over
the lungs where they are covered with heavy, dry
cloths. On recovery, rub the sides of the chest
so as to thoroughly dry the surface. A mustard
plaster, after the compress has been removed, is
quite generally used. A stimulating medicine may
be given during the early stages. Use a drench,
consisting of 8 tablespoonfuls of whiskey to 4 tablespoonfuls
of sweet spirits of niter. If the animal
is in very great distress, give a drench every two
or three hours consisting of 8 to 10 drops of Fleming&#8217;s
tincture of aconite, 2 tablespoonfuls of laudanum
mixed with a pint of cold water.</p>

<p>After the animal is on the road to recovery, stop
the use of these medicines and give a tonic consisting
of nitrate of potash or saltpeter and ground
gentian root, half and half. Give a teaspoonful
three times a day. While the animal is sick, a little
boiled flaxseed mixed with a soft food will keep the
bowels regular. It is not wise to give purgatives,
hence it is wise to give an injection consisting of
warm soapy water, so as to empty the bowels. From
two to four weeks of rest and care should be
allowed for complete recovery.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref137">INFLUENZA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A specific disease of the horse
affecting the mucous membrane of the air passages.
When the mucous membrane of the eyelids is affected,
pink eye results. Sometimes the mucous
membrane of the intestines is affected, in which
case colic or inflammation of the bowels results.
The common cause is exposure to cold. If no work
be required, plenty of fresh air be supplied, no drafts
admitted and careful nursing otherwise, the disease<span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span>
will run its course in from two to three weeks and
no medicines will be necessary. In cases where
considerable cough prevails, the custom of putting
a piece of camphor about the size of an egg in a
pail of boiling water and holding the horse&#8217;s head
over it from a quarter to a half hour at a time is to
be commended. The bowels should be kept free
and open. Any of the ordinary purgatives will do.
If weakness occurs, give 4 tablespoonfuls each of
tincture of ginger, ground gentian root and sweet
spirits of niter in a half pint of water three times a
day. Two tablespoonfuls of nitrate of potassium
given once or twice each day in the drinking water
is also desirable. As the trouble abates, the medicines
suggested before may be dropped and in
their place a teaspoonful of sulphate of iron and a
tablespoonful of ground gentian root may be given
daily in a bran mash or oatmeal gruel.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref138">INTESTINAL WORMS IN HORSES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Intestinal worms
may be classed as large and small. The large
worms inhabit the small intestines, and the small
ones the large intestines, the larger class of worms
being more readily reached by worm destroyers than
are the smaller ones, as the small intestines begin
at the stomach and as remedies leave the stomach,
the worm soon receives the dose prepared for it,
while if one dose has to pass through about 60 feet
of intestines before reaching the smaller worms in
the larger intestines, much of the worm remedy is
lost by mingling with the food, and diluted by
mixing with the digestive fluids. Thus what is a
remedy for the large species of worms will have
little effect upon the smaller ones.</p>

<p>As a farmer&#8217;s dose for the larger species of
worms, none, perhaps, is better than the following:
Oil of turpentine, 2 ounces; extract or oil of male<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
fern, one half ounce, mixed with 4 ounces of castor
oil and 8 ounces of pure raw linseed oil, with half a
pint of new milk, and given after the horse has
fasted for about 14 hours. Repeat the dose in a
week; then follow with two worm powders, common
smoking tobacco, eight ounces; powdered
worm seed, 6 ounces; powdered sulphate of iron,
4 ounces; mix with one-half pound each of salt and
granulated sugar. Every morning before the horse
is fed any other food, place a heaping tablespoonful
of the powder in four quarts of wet wheat bran
and allow the horse to eat it; continue for ten days
and the horse will be practically rid of worms of the
larger species. Colts should receive smaller doses
in proportion to age.</p>

<p>The small worms need the worm powder to be
given in the wheat bran every morning for fully
two weeks. Then follow with an ounce dose of
barbadoes aloes and a tablespoonful of ginger
given by mixing with about 12 ounces of warm
water and a gill of common molasses; wait a week
and repeat the powder treatment and follow with
the aloes. In a case of the very small or rectal
worms (pin worms) always use rectal injections, a
good enema being made by steeping for two hours
one pound of quassia chips in a gallon of soft
water; strain and add two ounces of common hard
soap; use the whole at once, using at about blood
temperature after the soap has dissolved. Repeat
in three days and continue as long as worms are
being brought away by the enemas.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref141">JAUNDICE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Until of recent date the disease in
the human so common at certain seasons of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
year was unknown among animals, or, at least,
if present had never been discovered by the veterinary
profession. But be that as it may, we are now
finding it in plenty among horses of all ages, from
colts up to aged horses; very prevalent among
sheep, and quite frequent among cattle. The early
writers on veterinary science usually attributed the
cause to gall stones. But that theory can hardly be
tenable in this country, where we find it essentially
more prevalent on low, marshy soils or on the hill
lands that have been long unplowed, where animals
are pastured, or hays are cut. The general symptoms
of it are a general dullness, hanging of the
head as though it ached, or pressing the head, if the
animal be a bovine or sheep, against the barn or
stall. The tongue will be found dry or covered
with a thick, sticky slime. The membranes of the
eyeball of a yellowish cast. In horses the tongue
will usually have a black coating. The appetite
in all animals is capricious. They will eat well one
day and scarcely touch food the next. As a rule,
they will manifest great thirst, yet will drink but
little. There are exceptions to this, however. The
voidings are not uniform. Sometime the urine is
quite high colored; at other times not. But, as a
rule, it is scanty. The feces are sometimes quite
hard and covered with a shiny slime. At other
times there will be extreme looseness of the evacuations.
These last symptoms are to be well considered
in using a treatment when the voidings are
hard and slimy. In case it is a horse that is ailing,
a physic of aloes should be given, one ounce being
the dose for a thousand pounds of horse, and two
teaspoonfuls of podophylin. Give this dissolved in
water and pour down as a drench, and follow with a
bitter tonic for from two to four weeks, or until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
voidings are normal and all scurf is removed from
the tongue. As a tonic for this none is better than
a mixture of powdered gentian root, six ounces,
powdered golden seal 2 ounces, powdered sulphate
of iron 4 ounces, well mixed in 1 pound of common
salt. Give in the feed a tablespoonful in ground
oats three times a day, until improvement takes
place. Then drop to twice a day and later once a
day. In case of the bowels being very loose always
give a pint dose of a mixture of castor oil 4 ounces,
pure raw linseed oil 12 ounces. Then follow with
the tonic powder named. The symptoms in cattle
are quite similar to those of the horse, except the
bovine&#8217;s eyes usually discharge some, yet not profusely,
and there are frequently puffy swellings beneath
their lower jaws. In case their bowels are
abnormally loose, give the oil as for the horse. If
constipated give from one to two pounds of
Epsom salts at one dose as the physic, with the
podophylin added as for the horse, and follow with
the same tonic powder. In the case of sheep, which
are by nature constipated animals, nothing equals
a ten-grain dose of calomel, followed the next day
with a four or six-ounce dose of Epsom salts (sulphate
of magnesia), and as sheep are reluctant to
eat any tonics in their feed, we are compelled to
pour their medicine down them. Mix together 4
ounces each of the tincture of gentian, golden seal,
ginger and iron, and give a tablespoonful twice a
day in a half pint of water. But always give the
calomel, as it will clean out the liver of a sheep as
no other known agent will. The symptoms are
much the same as in cattle. Begin treatment early
or success will not follow.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref145">LICE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Farm animals, especially those housed in
stables more or less infested with insects and
vermin, are commonly troubled with lice. Animals
in good health resist the insects, but those already
in a non-thrifty condition do not fare so well. Lice
cause a good deal of annoyance to farm stock, inasmuch
as they bite the skin, suck out blood, and
thus cause considerable irritation. Lice can be seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
with the naked eye. Infestation, as a rule, takes
place in filthy quarters, and the best means of disinfecting
such places is by the use of a spray of
kerosene. One of the best means of applying this
to hogs consists in rubbing posts, which are constantly
smeared with kerosene. In this way the
hogs are induced to treat themselves. Infected
hogs may also be treated by pouring the kerosene
directly over the infested parts, like the neck,
shoulder and back. Dipping tanks made of cement
or wood are frequently located in the run-yards, in
which is placed some disinfectant fluid. Hogs use
these small tanks as wallows, and in this way they
disinfect themselves.</p>

<p>For horses and cattle a good remedy is made as
follows: Boil for an hour 8 tablespoonfuls of
arsenic, 8 tablespoonfuls of soda ash and 16 tablespoonfuls
of soft soap in two gallons of water.
After being prepared by boiling, add enough
water to make two gallons. When cool, wet the
animal all over with a little of it, using a brush
or currycomb to get it into the skin. Another
good remedy is made of boiling stavesacre
seeds, 1 part to 20 parts of water, for an hour
and let it simmer for another hour; then add
water to make it up to the original bulk. This
applied to the affected parts brings quick relief. It
is advisable to repeat the application in a week or
ten days, so as to catch any new lice from any eggs
that were not caught by the first application. A
very common treatment is secured by mixing a pint
of linseed oil, 8 tablespoonfuls of oil of tar, and 8
tablespoonfuls of sulphur. This is then rubbed on
the affected parts once a day for two days and
allowed to remain for a few days, after which it is
washed off with soap and water. In serious cases,<span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span>
the application should be repeated within a week
or so.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref146">LIVER FLUKES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These are parasites usually
found in the liver or its ducts. At times they are
present in great numbers, giving rise to a serious
disease called liver rot. When the fertilized eggs are
discharged in the excrement of diseased animals and
fall in fresh water they hatch out and are taken into
the body by sheep and cattle, either
in the food or drink. In a short time
thereafter they have entrenched
themselves in the liver of cattle or
sheep.</p>

<div class="figleft w150p" id="Fig42">
<img src="images/illo207.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="356" />
<p class="caption main">LIVER FLUKE</p>
</div>

<p>A few liver flukes in an animal
causes little trouble, as the injury is
largely mechanical anyway. No
peculiar symptoms are conspicuous
when only a few flukes are present.
The greatest damage is done when
hundreds of flukes develop in a single
individual. In these cases the
flow of the bike is checked. As result
the health becomes impaired and
the usual penalties of malnutrition follow. Swelling
of the jaws and diarrh&#339;a are often noticed in
connection with the disease.</p>

<p>When the host is badly infected with the flukes
and in a badly run-down condition the trouble is always
serious, and medicinal treatment is of little
real value. Tonics and good food may be given to
help along&mdash;but death usually follows. Salt is
helpful as the flukes are sensitive to it. If an
animal that has succumbed to the disease be examined,
the liver will be observed to be fairly rotten
as a result of the inroads of the parasites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span></p>

<p>Treatment is in line of prevention only. Clean,
pure fresh water, free of the eggs or the parasites,
is necessary if the trouble is to be eradicated. The
old ponds, ordinarily filled with stagnant water,
should be drained. They harbor many bad parasites,
and their harm is far beyond their value.
When water for sheep and cattle is taken from pure
streams or wells the trouble from liver flukes and
other parasites is reduced to a minimum.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref147">LOCKJAW.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This disease, very frequently called
tetanus, is an infectious disease in which the body
muscles are spasmodically contracted or stiffened.
The muscles that move the jaw are frequently affected
and the animal is unable to open the mouth.
Because of this condition the disease is commonly
known as lockjaw.</p>

<p>The spread of the disease does not occur through
healthy animals coming in contact with animals
having tetanus, but by inoculation. The germ of
tetanus is present in the soil, manure and dust.
It enters the body by way of wounds, especially
punctured and bruised wounds. The injury may
result from stepping on a nail, and the germs are
planted in the deeper structures of the foot. Such
a wound usually has poor drainage, the horn of the
hoof closing the mouth or opening. Here the germs
grow and produce a poisonous toxin that is said
to be the most powerful produced by any bacteria.
This toxin acts on the nerve centers of the brain
and spinal cord, causing extensive spasmodic contraction
of the body muscles.</p>

<p>Tetanus sometimes occurs in the absence of any
noticeable wound. It may be in such cases that
the seat of the infection is a slight abrasion of the
skin, or the lining membranes of the respiratory
and digestive tracts. The tetanus bacillus is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
slender, spore-producing bacterium. The spore is
located at one end of the rod in the form of a round
head, that gives the organism a pin shape, hence
the name of pin bacillus. It is very resistant to
outside conditions and the action of the chemical
disinfectants. It is because of its ability to resist
the action of disinfectants and the fact that it
develops best when protected or covered by the
tissues and wound secretions, that this disease so
often follows ordinary wound treatment.</p>

<p class="caption main">LOCKJAW</p>
<p class="caption subshort">Note the rigid, tense position of the muscles.</p>
</div>

<p>From a few days to several weeks may lapse
from the time of infection with the germs until the
development of the stiffness and spasms. Sometimes
the wound by which the organism has entered
the tissues has healed before the symptoms of
tetanus are manifested. In case the symptoms develop
a few days after the inoculation the disease<span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span>
is severe or acute in form, and less violent or subacute
if the symptoms are manifested after the
second week. The above statement does not hold
true in all cases, but it may be considered true in
a general way.</p>

<p>Of the domestic animals the horse is the most
commonly affected. The symptoms shown by this
animal are very characteristic. Any person that
has had the opportunity to see and examine a horse
suffering from tetanus should have no trouble in
recognizing the disease in other animals.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref148">The Characteristic Symptom</h4>

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;is the spasmodic
contraction of the muscles. This may vary in the
different individuals, depending on the susceptibility
of the animal and the quantity of poisonous
toxin present in the system. There is at first a
slight stiffness of the muscles of the back, neck,
head, and limbs, and the animal is more nervous
than common. A noise in the stable or a slap with
the hand may increase the stiffness and contractions
temporarily. The contracted condition of the
muscles of the eye, are, perhaps, the most noticeable
early in the disease. These muscles pull the
eyeball backwards, the fatty cushion is pressed on
and the third eyelid protrudes, covering at times
from one-third to two-thirds of the front part of
the eye. In the severe form of the disease the
muscles feel hard, especially those of the back and
neck, and the animal moves with difficulty. In
addition to the muscular symptoms, the respiration
and pulse beats are quickened and the body temperature
higher than normal. The evidence of suffering
from the contracted condition of the muscles
is very marked, and, unless supported in some way,
the animal may fall to the floor. If the symptoms
develop a few days after infection, the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span>
usually dies. The acute form is very fatal, but in
the mild or subacute form the chance for making a
recovery is good.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref149">Tetanus Is a Preventable Disease.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;It may be
largely prevented by the careful disinfection of
wounds, and the use of anti-tetanic serum. In most
localities the proper treatment of the wound is a
sufficient preventive measure, but in localities and
stables where the disease is common the anti-tetanic
serum should be used. Ordinary cleansing of a
wound, as practiced by most stockmen, is not sufficient
to destroy the bacillus of tetanus. The
wound must be carefully cleaned, disinfected and
prepared for healing. This should be kept in mind
when treating a wound, and instead of using an
agent that we know little about, we should secure
reliable information regarding the different commercial
disinfectants and methods of caring for wounds.
That class known as tar disinfectants is most commonly
used. The better grade belonging to this
class should be used.</p>

<p>If anti-tetanic serum is used, it should be injected
as soon after the injury has occurred as possible.
The injection is made hypodermically, usually beneath
the skin on the side of the neck. Large doses
of anti-tetanic serum given after the symptoms have
developed may assist recovery. However, in the
severe form of the disease this treatment is uncertain.</p>

<p>When the animal comes down with the disease,
it should be made as comfortable as possible. The
quarters should be roomy, quiet, clean, and well
ventilated. It is advisable to support the horse with
a sling unless the animal is worried or made nervous
by it. This prevents his becoming tired and
falling down. We should give the animal the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page212">[212]</span>
of care in the way of regulating the diet, etc., but
should avoid annoying it by our attention. Medicinal
treatment is of little benefit and should be
given a secondary place. In fact, dosing the animal
with medicine, especially if large doses are given,
may do more harm than good in the treatment of
this disease.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref150">LOCO DISEASE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The word loco is a Spanish
word, and means crazy. Loco disease is a disease
of the brain and nervous system, especially of horses
and cattle, but may also affect other animals. It
results from eating any one of a number of poisonous
plants called loco which grow upon the dry,
sandy prairies of some parts of the Western United
States.</p>

<p>In winter and early spring, when there is little
or no grass, some animals acquire an appetite for
this plant, and soon refuse all other kinds of food.
When addicted to the weed an animal loses flesh
rapidly, the eyesight becomes affected&mdash;often it has
no knowledge of distance&mdash;and frequently when
made to step over a board or rail will jump over it
as though it were several feet high. Later, in the
course of the disease, the brain becomes more
affected and the animal acts more or less crazy, at
times quite violent, at others depressed and dull.</p>

<p>Should the animal live through the first attack
it may linger for months or even years, but it
usually dies as a result of the attack. Frequently
some peculiar &#8220;foolish&#8221; habit follows the animals
through life. Some have a nervous fit when excited
or warmed up, others will not lead and some you
cannot drive at all. There is no cure for the
trouble. All that can be done is to prevent the
habit from being formed or by removing the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page213">[213]</span>
from temptation and furnishing wholesome, nutritious
food.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref152">LUNGS, CONGESTION OF.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A filling of the
lungs with blood. This is very common with
horses in winter and is most frequently due to a
chill. Animals that have been put to heavy work,
or are in a weakened condition, are frequently susceptible
if left standing in a draft while still warm.
Sluggishness is noticed, first followed by trembling
at the flank, heavy breathing; the pulse will be
noted as quick, but weak; a gurgling sound will
be noted if the ear is placed against the chest. The
best treatment is such as gives quick relief. If at
work, place the horse at rest at once in the stable
and cover with blanket. Have plenty of fresh air
admitted, but do not allow a draft to blow over the
patient. Assist circulation as much as possible by
rubbing of the legs and apply cold pad to the chest.
A mustard plaster applied over the chest is very
good. A good drench consists of alcohol in 2
ounce doses, well diluted in water; at the same
time another drench consisting of 4 tablespoonfuls
of sweet spirits of niter and 2 tablespoonfuls of
laudanum, mixed with a pint of water, is also very
good. If the conditions indicate that the lungs
are full of blood, add 10 drops of Fleming&#8217;s tincture
of aconite to the drench. The drenches may be
given two or three hours apart until relief comes,
at which time quiet is advised, although a little
gentle walking for exercise is advisable.</p>

<p>From this time on treat the animal as a patient,
giving easily digested foods. A tonic consisting of
ground gentian root and nitrate of potash, half and
half, is excellent. Give a teaspoonful of this in the
feed three times a day.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref154">LUNG WORMS IN LAMBS AND CALVES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;It
has been proven in years gone by that the common
spirits of turpentine, when mixed with salt in
proportions of a gill of turpentine to four quarts of
common fine salt and placed in a covered box so
constructed that sheep and calves can get their
head in and eat the salt (yet the salt be protected
from the weather), will practically prevent an infection.
Some have advised the mixing of a half
pint of sublimed sulphur with the salt and turpentine.
There can be no objection to the sulphur
when added in the proportions named. This
remedy is not a cure but a preventive. In fact
there is no cure, as these worms are in the bronchial
tubes and lungs, where no worm destroyer can
reach them directly. But when the lamb or calf
daily partakes of even a few drops of turpentine,
the whole system becomes, to an extent, infected
with the turpentine, and as the young worms come
into existence, their home in the lungs becomes a
very unhealthy home for them and they fail to
mature. In some cases mature worms have been
removed by injecting a mixture of turpentine,
chloroform and olive oil into the windpipe, using
about a teaspoonful of this mixture. Its effect is to
stupefy the worms that it touches, and they may
be coughed out by the suffering lamb or calf. The
fumes of burning sulphur has also been advised
by some veterinarians. But both remedies are as
liable to kill as cure, and are by no means always
successful. The farmer&#8217;s business should be to
prevent, not cure, diseases of this class; therefore
prepare the salt box.</p>

<p class="caption main">LYMPHANGITIS</p>
<p class="caption sublong">This kind of inflammation is usually seen in the hind
legs. It is most frequent in heavy draft horses, or in coarse
plethoric individuals. It occurs most frequently after a short
period of idleness.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref155">LYMPHANGITIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An inflammation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span>
lymphatics, usually of the hind legs. Hence
the name &#8220;big legs.&#8221; It is the result of
too rich feeding, and too little work in many<span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span>
cases on the one hand, or of overwork and
insufficient food on the other. Lymphangitis often
follows other diseases like distemper, influenza, or
pneumonia, in which cases the system is weakened
and the lymphatics in abnormal condition. It shows
itself after a short period of idleness and rest. It
usually begins with a chill and a rise of temperature,
which may be as much as 105 degrees, depending
on the intensity of the attack. One or
both hind legs may show swelling and be so stiff
and sore after standing during the night as to be
moved only with difficulty when the horse is taken
out of the stable in the morning. The horse in
moving seems able to bear little or no weight on
the affected leg. At the same time, the pulse is
full and throbby, respiration is fast, the bowels are
constipated and the appetite is lost.</p>

<p>In some cases the legs swell to an enormous size.
If the inflammation is not relieved in a few days,
the glands get badly diseased and blood poison may
result. The disease, however, if taken in time, is
easily treated. If it is caused by overfeeding, change
this; give more exercise. When the disease is first
noticed, give the horse 4 tablespoonfuls of aloes, 4
tablespoonfuls of carbonate of soda and 4 tablespoonfuls
of ginger. These should be dissolved in
a half pint of boiling water, then mixed with a half
pint of cold water, and then given as a drench. If
the pulse is fast, it may be made easier and slower
by giving 20 to 30 drops of tincture of aconite,
every couple of hours. A couple of tablespoonfuls
of nitrate of potash in the drinking water three
times a day will increase the urine. This is desirable
to do in this disease. The leg should be
bathed for at least a half an hour and then dried
and a wash consisting of 2 tablespoonfuls of acetate<span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span>
of lead, 8 tablespoonfuls of tincture of opium, and
a quart of water should be applied to the legs. This
should be rubbed in well with the hand every hour.
In from 20 to 30 hours, a great change for the better
will be noticed the inflammation will have been
reduced; the pain will have disappeared and the
bowels will be loose and active.</p>

<p>From now on give general exercise at frequent
periods, during the day. In cases caused by overwork
or too little food or those following debilitating
diseases, like influenza or distemper, the treatment
should be more stimulating; therefore, nutritive
foods and tonics are best. Good hay and oats
and other feed of a laxative nature should be furnished.</p>

<p>A preparation, consisting of 4 tablespoonfuls,
each, of tincture chloride of iron, tincture of gentian,
and ginger in a pint of water three times a day
will be found both stimulating and nourishing. If
the disease has progressed so far that the legs
break and show that matter is formed, wash them
with warm water and follow with acetate of lead,
sulphate of iron and carbolic acid. Use 2 tablespoonfuls
of each in a quart of water and apply
twice each day. If the swelling hangs on use
Fowler&#8217;s solution of arsenic, 4 tablespoonfuls to a
dose in a bran mash once a day. Continue this for
four or five weeks. A salve made of 2 teaspoonfuls
of iodide and 8 tablespoonfuls of vaseline should
also be rubbed on the leg twice a week.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref157">MAGGOTS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The grubs of the ordinary flesh-flies
so common about stables and houses. The
adult fly deposits the minute larv&aelig; in fresh meat,
in wounds, and frequently in dirty wool. These
become the maggots so well known about the farm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
The distress caused by these when present in a
wound is considerable, and they endanger life.</p>

<p>The best treatment is in line of cleanliness. Keep
old wounds clean by means of antiseptic washes
and tag the sheep that no filth and dirt may accumulate.
If for any reason maggots are found,
open the infected part and remove, if possible, both
the maggots and sloughed tissue. Old sores or
wounds, if they will not lend themselves to complete
removal of the maggots, should be treated
with a solution of carbolic acid and water. On
some, turpentine can be used. Chloroform may be
sprayed on, or injected into the wound with almost
instant results. After the maggots are destroyed
follow up the treatment with a good disinfectant
until the wound has healed.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref158">MALLENDERS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An eruption of the skin above
the feet in horses. The disease at first is very much
like eczema. In time the watery fluid dries up and
the sore parts become covered with hard crusts
and scabs. The sore spots should be washed with
some good disinfectant and repeated frequently
enough to destroy the infection. A moderate purge
is advisable. See that only wholesome food is provided.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref159">MAMMITIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Inflammation of the mammary
gland or udder. The disease is frequently called
caked bag and garget. In the last named, the milk
secretion is altered and appears as a thick or a
stringy fluid. Heavy milkers are most commonly
affected. The udder becomes swollen, hot and
somewhat tender just before calving. The swelling
may extend forward along the belly. It often gets
so severe as to require treatment. It is in this
sense physiological. In a few days after calving,
as a rule, the swelling disappears and the normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span>
condition is regained more quickly if the calf is
allowed to suck the cow. In the first stages bloody
milk is secreted and often pus is formed in one
quarter or more of the udder. The udder should
be carefully milked, cleaned, and, if the milk ducts
are closed, it may be necessary to use a milk tube.
This should be used cautiously so as not to injure
the tissue of the udder and should be perfectly
clean before inserting, otherwise serious inflammation
may result. In bathing, use hot water for
15 to 20 minutes at a time, after which rub dry and
apply an ointment made by dissolving 3 tablespoonfuls
of gum camphor and 4 tablespoonfuls of fluid
extract of belladonna to a pint of clean, fresh lard.
This ointment should be applied three times a day.</p>

<p>A more serious form of the disease is known as
contagious mammitis, and is due to invasion of the
gland by bacteria. In cases of this kind the inflammation
is more extensive and the disorder calls
for more careful treatment. Since the milk contains
bad bacteria, it is necessary to destroy them
so as to prevent spreading of the disease. The
milker should have clean hands and should wash
them in a disinfecting solution before milking another
cow. The milk tube may be necessary in
withdrawing the milk. After the milk has been
removed from the udder, inject a solution of peroxide
of hydrogen or dioxygen or a solution of
carbolic acid, 1 part to 50 parts of boiled water.
After the solution has acted for a few minutes, it
should be milked out. The external treatment for
contagious mammitis should be similar to that of
ordinary mammitis.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref192">Scab in Cattle</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref161">MILK FEVER.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;It is a remarkable fact that this
disease occurs most commonly in cows which<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
calved easily. This is explained by the fact that in
such cases the os uteri remains relaxed for a greater
length of time than it does in cases of difficult parturition.
Milk fever generally occurs in cows
which are heavy milkers, and great eaters. Keeping
the animals in permanent stables, and feeding
large quantities of rich food while they are giving
no milk are predisposing causes.</p>

<p>The disease makes its appearance usually in from
24 to 48 hours after parturition. It seldom occurs
after the third day, and some authors state that it
has never been recognized before the starting of the
milk secretion. The most salient symptoms to the
average layman would, perhaps, be the anxious expression
of the animal, bellowing and mounting into
the manger. Later they become very weak, stagger
and fall, and are unable to rise. The members
are usually extended in a rigid position. A rattling
or whistling noise is heard in case the larynx is
paralyzed. The feet, ears and horns feel cold to the
touch. When a case is going to recover we see
improvement as early as the second or third day.
Recovery is usually complete at the end of from
two to five days.</p>

<p>Milk fever is one of the cases where the old
maxim, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound
of cure, is doubly applicable. If proper precautions
were taken a large number of cases could be prevented.
Give the pregnant animals daily exercise,
and decrease their allowance of food.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref162">Treatment Very Simple.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Make the cow comfortable.
Now give her a small dose of Epsom salts
from one-half to one pound, depending on her size.
This should be given as a drench. Animals afflicted
with this ailment swallow with difficulty. Use
care that the drench does not get into the lungs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span>
Perhaps the most satisfactory medical treatment is
to use what is known as the Schmidt treatment.
This is nothing more than injecting into the udder
a solution made by dissolving in one quart of clean
boiled water 3 teaspoonfuls of iodide of potash,
after stripping all milk from the udder. A very
satisfactory way is to get a rubber tube, attach it
to a common milking tube which is placed into the
teats in turn and pour the solution into the tube
by means of a funnel. By massaging the udder
the solution can be worked into each quarter in a
short time without difficulty.</p>

<p>In case iodide of potash is not available, inject
air into the udder after drawing out the milk. I
have known of many cases where air has been forced
into the udder by means of a bicycle pump, and the
animal recovered in a very short time. If the disease
does not respond to the treatment with readiness,
repeat in a few hours, say, anywhere from
five to ten hours after. Cold water or ice on the
head is advisable. The use of stimulants is also
recommended. Whiskey can be given in doses of
10 to 15 tablespoonfuls and jamaica ginger 6 to 8
tablespoonfuls. Milk the cow frequently and massage
the udder, bathing in hot water.</p>

<p>After the cow is on the way to recovery, withhold
milk-stimulating foods for a few days and give
some tonic like gentian and nux vomica, half and
half, 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls two or three times a day.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref163">MONDAY MORNING SICKNESS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref8a">Azoturia</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref164">NASAL GLEET.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;When a cold or simple
catarrh is neglected it may run into a chronic condition
giving rise to nasal gleet. A thin, bluish discharge
comes from the nose; and the membranes
of the nostrils, instead of being moist and pink in<span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span>
color, take on a leaden hue. The coat at the same
time shows unthriftiness. In such cases the face
and head may swell because the accumulated materials
fail to pass out. When these bunches are
tapped with the fingers, a dull sound is heard.
Treatment consists of isolating the animals and giving
them good care, nutritious food and well-ventilated
quarters. A bucket, filled with boiling
water, in which a half cup of turpentine is placed,
and held under the nose to steam the nostrils and
face, is excellent. Any sort of blanketing that will
hold the steam about the head is very good to
have at hand at the time. For internal treatment
give a teaspoonful of sulphate of copper three times
daily in a small bran mash; following this drop the
copper sulphate and give 2 tablespoonfuls of
Fowler&#8217;s solution of arnica twice a day in the mash.
Should the bulges on the face become large, it will
be necessary to open them. Often a part of the
bone requires sawing out to get effective results.
In these severe cases it is best to have your veterinarian
make the operation.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref165">NAVICULAR DISEASE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A disease of the
navicular bone and the structures surrounding it.
It is called &#8220;coffin joint lameness.&#8221; This bone is
situated at the back and inferior part of the coffin
joint, and acts as a pulley over which the flexor
tendon of the foot passes. Horses with upright
pasterns are most liable to it, as more weight is
thrown on this joint. Those shod with calkins on
their shoes, which prevent the frog from coming
in contact with the ground, therefore causing a
shock to this joint, are also very liable to it. Some
horses have hereditary tendency to this disease.
Nails penetrating too deep through the sole, or
anything that will cause inflammation of this joint,<span class="pagenum" id="Page223">[223]</span>
is likely to produce navicular disease. The most
prolific cause is bad shoeing. By degrees the inflammation
in a chronic form extends to other
parts, causing a shrinking of the soft parts, resulting
in contraction of the foot.</p>

<p>The lameness may appear suddenly and perhaps
immediately after the horse has been shod, and is
then usually thought to be the fault of nailing on
the shoe. It is likely in this case that the smith
has pared the sole and frog too thin, and that the
part has suffered from a bruise by the horse stepping
on something hard. After a rest it may disappear,
to return after the next drive. Sometimes
the disease is of very slow progress in one or both
fore feet. The first thing that is noticed is that the
animal points its toe, and if both are affected, first
one, then the other. The animal may not be lame,
but it does not step out so well as it used to, and
by degrees the part gets more tender, until the
animal begins to go lame, and the lameness gradually
gets worse. There is a form of this lameness
where the animal shows stiffness and lameness
when first taken out of the stable, but, after being
driven for a short distance, it passes off, and after
it stands for awhile it will start off lame again. If
this disease lasts for some time the muscles of the
chest and shoulders seem stiff and may shrink. This
has been called &#8220;chest founder&#8221; by horsemen.
This is brought about by the soreness of the feet.
The horse is afraid to step out, giving it the appearance
of being stiff; the muscles of the chest
and shoulders will shrink from want of proper
action, caused by the feet being sore. If there is
heat and tenderness in the hollow of the heel or a
redness of the sole, and an absence of any other
disease of the foot or leg, we may consider with<span class="pagenum" id="Page224">[224]</span>
almost a certainty that it is a case of navicular or
coffin joint lameness. The result is contraction of
the foot.</p>

<p>Take off the shoes, so that the frog will rest on
the ground, then poultice the feet with bran, made
up with cold water if it is a recent case, but if it is
of some months&#8217; standing hot water is better than
cold; put the poultices into bags made a little
larger than the foot; put about two inches deep of
the bran mash into the bag, then put the foot in
and fill in all around as high as the fetlock, and tie
the bag above the fetlock and around the ankle to
keep it well on the foot. Wet this several times a
day and change it once daily. Continue this for
two weeks, and see that it is properly done; if not,
it will be of no service. Then blister the coronet
with cantharides 2 teaspoonfuls and lard 4 tablespoonfuls.
Repeat in three weeks, and give the
animal a long rest.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref167">NODULAR DISEASE IN SHEEP.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Nodules
resembling those of tuberculosis found in the intestines
of sheep, are due to the presence of parasitic
worms. Profuse diarrh&#339;a and a pronounced
anemic condition prevail. A post mortem examination
of the intestines discloses the presence of
numerous nodules in the intestinal walls. If the
worm is present, no treatment is possible, for the
reason that any medicine that would affect the
worm would also affect the tissues and lead to
their destruction. Prevention, therefore, is the
only means of overcoming the disease. Sheep must
be kept off infested pastures, and infested pastures
must be plowed and given over to cultivated crops.
Give lambs only clean pastures to graze over. This
means crop rotation in connection with sheep husbandry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span>
No feed that has been tramped over by
infected sheep should ever be supplied to lambs
or sheep not infested with the disease.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Difficult parturition is common
in some females. And frequently others, less
bothered as a rule with any difficulty at this period,
deliver their offspring only after great labor and
much difficulty. When such cases occur close
vigilance not only frequently hastens delivery, but
often saves the life of either the mother or offspring
or both.</p>

<p>In many instances the trouble is seated in the
womb; the neck of the womb remains closed,
and even though long-continued and vigorous efforts
are made, the offspring does not arrive. In
cases of this kind assistance can be rendered which
quickly removes the difficulty. First oil the hand
and forearm and work the fingers into the passage,
gently pressing it open. If the womb does not

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref169">Manner of Delivery.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The natural position of the
fetus at birth calls for the fore feet forward with
the head resting on the knees. The fore feet, therefore,
in a normal delivery, are first presented and
then the head. If the fetus is not unduly large,
the mother will likely force the delivery without
assistance. In case the struggle is extended gentle
assistance will be in order. This can be rendered
by a gentle pull on the legs and head. If this does
not bring the offspring, you can consider that something
is wrong. However, do not be hasty, just
give time. Mares usually deliver in a few minutes
and cows often require an hour or so after labor
begins. If you conclude that something is wrong
oil the hand and arm. Shove the fetus back and
ascertain, if possible, the trouble. If this examination
shows dropsy of the abdomen&mdash;water in the
belly&mdash;puncture the abdomen with a knife in order
that the fetus may be delivered. If the trouble is
with the head&mdash;water in the brain&mdash;puncture the
head that the water may run out, and then remove
the arm and hand. When the struggle pains come
on again, give a gentle pull and delivery will follow.</p>

<p>Frequently the position is changed. Sometimes
but one fore foot appears with the head, making it
impossible to deliver the offspring. When a case
like this occurs, shove the fetus back and bring
the unpresented leg forward where it belongs, and
then likely no further trouble will result. If the
legs are in proper place but the head turned backward,
it will be necessary to push the fetus back
into the womb and bring the head forward in position.
In case the head resists your efforts, adjust
a noose over the head, and while you work with
your hand inside, have an assistant gently pull on
the rope, in order to draw the head into the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span>
position. After the head and fore feet are put in
natural position, delivery will follow without further
difficulty.</p>

<p>When all four feet appear together it is necessary
to push the fore feet back into the womb just
as far as it is possible to force them. This done,
pull now on the hind feet and bring the fetus out,
hind feet first. It is always a mistake to attempt
delivery with the head first when delivery has proceeded
as suggested in cases of this nature.</p>

<p class="caption main">ABNORMAL PRESENTATION OF THE FOAL</p>
<p class="caption subshort">Delivery is not possible in either of the cases here illustrated.
Where such occur assistance must be rendered. See
article on <a href="#Ref168">obstetrics</a> for treatment.</p>
</div>

<p>Where delivery is attempted with the hind legs
foremost, it is regarded as safe, provided the feet
come out as they should. If any difficulty is encountered,
shove the fetus back, straighten the
legs, and then with the renewal of the labor struggles
assist the mother by a gentle pull on the hind
legs.</p>

<p>Another common presentation is where you feel
nothing but the tail, rump and hips. Adjust the
fetus for proper delivery by shoving the hind end
upwards and towards the front of the womb, then
slip the hand down and get hold of the foot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
the hind leg and lift upwards and backwards until
the legs are brought out into the passage. Now
repeat the work for the other leg and the job is
done.</p>

<p>It is always a good plan, after difficult parturition,
especially when any abnormal discharge appears,
to wash out the womb with warm water in
which a little carbolic acid or creolin is placed.
Use this daily for a few days.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref170">PALISADE WORM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The worms are found in
the horse in two periods of existence. The mature
worms are usually found attached to the mucous
membrane of the intestinal wall of the large intestine,
with the head sunk deep for the purpose of
sucking blood, which gives them the brown or red
color. The immature are found sometimes in the
same organs, in a small capsule covering, in small
pellets of manure, in cavities or cysts, varying in
size from a pin-head to that of a hazel nut, in the
walls of the intestines, and also in the arteries and
other structures of the body.</p>

<p>When present in the kidneys or in the arteries
leading to the kidneys, or in the surrounding tissues,
a horse is especially sensitive to pressure over
the loins. They have been known to cause paralysis.
When found in the brain, an animal, when
working, suddenly begins to stagger, the eyes become
fixed, and the horse shows many of the symptoms
of &#8220;blind staggers.&#8221; When the large arteries
of the abdomen are affected, and this is their favorable
location in the circulatory system, the animal
is frequently subject to colic, which often results
in death. This is also the case when found in
great numbers in the intestines.</p>

<p>From a thorough investigation of a great many
cases, both before and after death, the conclusions<span class="pagenum" id="Page229">[229]</span>
are drawn that the parasite evolves a poisonous
substance (toxin), which, in many instances,
stupefies the brain or parts of the nervous system
of the horse, and in that way causes coma, paralysis
and death of the animal.</p>

<p>Prevention is the best treatment. Hay and fodder
from swampy land are to be looked upon as
suspicious. Pastures which are subject to overflow
should be avoided. Medicinal treatment consists
of a prolonged, careful use of some of the
essential oils or other vermifuges. The ordinary
spirits of turpentine has proved a fairly good common
remedy. An ordinary animal will stand 8
tablespoonfuls of turpentine given in a pint to a
quart of raw linseed oil, thoroughly mixed. If the
animal is badly affected, the above dose may be
given night and morning for two or three days,
then omit for a week or two and repeat. The
remedy should be discontinued as soon as the
animal shows signs of irritation of the kidneys.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref171">PARALYSIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A loss of power over some of the
muscles due to a disordered state of the brain or
nerves. This may result from disease or injury or
some irritation. In horses and cattle the hindquarters
are not infrequently affected in this way,
the result of indigestion from constipation or from
attacks of colic. The animal shows weakness in
one hind limb, moving it with difficulty when the
opposite limb may then become affected. If the
attack is very severe, the animal falls on its
haunches and may not be able to rise. Temperature,
pulse and respiration, all are rather normal.
Treatment should be directed to remove the cause
of the disease. When there is colic or constipation,
give purges. A half teaspoonful of extract of
nux vomica, given in a pint of milk twice a day, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
very good. Pouring cold water from a height and
then immediately hot water sometimes greatly
strengthens the muscles and has its use in treating.
Rubbing the parts with mustard stimulates
them, and in some cases good results. Paralysis
resulting from injury usually disappears as the part
returns to its normal state.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref172">PARASITES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These are living plants or
animals that live temporarily or continually in the
bodies of other plants or animals and draw their
nourishment from their host. It is doubtful if
there is a single farm animal that does not harbor
parasites at nearly all times during its life. There
may be many of these in the same individual at the
same time. Parasites may be harmful or not, as
the case may be. Parasites may be divided into
two classes&mdash;plant parasites and animal parasites.
The bacteria and molds are the most important
among the former, whereas in the latter certain
minute protozoa, certain forms of insects and certain
worms are the most commonly met. Such
diseases as staggers, tuberculosis, and typhoid
fever are the result of bacterial diseases, while
Texas fever is an example of the protozoa class;
and then the insects and worms are types with
which we are all acquainted. When a disease is
caused by either, discussion will be found under
the name of that disease.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref175">PERITONITIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An inflammation of the membrane
which lines the abdominal cavity and which
also invests the abdominal organs. It may be
caused from some exposure to cold after some
weakening disease. Some injury to the abdomen<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
or belly may cause it, or it may start from some
inflammation that has attacked the stomach, liver,
intestines, or the spleen. When attacked, a slight
pain is felt and the animal lies down, stretches
himself, sweats freely, and moans. Then he rises,
walks about somewhat, and all the time breathes
heavy and shows much weakness. The pulse runs
up between 75 and 100 beats a minute. In time the
legs and ears get cold. A good treatment is a pint of
raw linseed oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of laudanum, and
10 drops of aconite. Mix these and give as a
drench. A mustard plaster for the abdomen and
something hot for the back are desirable. In two
hours, if the pain continues, give 4 tablespoonfuls
of laudanum and 10 drops aconite in a pint of lukewarm
water. Use as a drench.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref176">PINK EYE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A contagious epidemic disease of
the horse affecting the animal all over and particularly
the membranes of the air passages. There
is general debility, considerable cough, and a general
discharge from the nostrils. The transparent covering
of the eyeball becomes inflamed. At times the
disease is very fatal, many horses succumbing to it.
It is most common in the spring.</p>

<p>One of the symptoms is the general weakness of
the animal. He hangs his head, and trembles; has
little appetite and appears cold. The eyes show
a watery discharge and later a stare coat. The pulse
at first is weak, but quick, and later rising to 80 or
90 beats a minute. At this stage the temperature
is high, around 103 to 105 degrees. The breathing
is accelerated to about 50 times a minute. The
bowels do not act, or act very poorly, and the urine
is very scanty. In treating, first isolate the animal
and disinfect the stables to prevent spreading. Any
of the common disinfectants will do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span></p>

<p>Good nursing is necessary. Keep the horse
warm with blankets. Give him soft, nourishing
food. The eyes should be bathed three or four
times a day with hot water. A little boric acid,
say, a teaspoonful to a half pint of water, is good
to use as a wash for the eyes and nostrils. To
keep the kidneys active and to reduce the fever, give
a tablespoonful of nitrate of potash dissolved in
water two or three times a day. If the
horse is very weak, one-half glass of whiskey in a
pint of gruel three times a day is stimulating and
helpful. It is better not to give any physic of any
kind. After recovery, the horse should be given
little or no work. A long rest of several weeks is
necessary.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref177">PLACENTA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The covering of the fetus, commonly
called the afterbirth. As a rule, this comes
away with the birth of the offspring. Occasionally
in the cow it remains attached to the walls of the
uterus, and if not removed will cause trouble, if
not sickness and death. Soon after the birth of the
calf, if the afterbirth remains, decomposition sets in
and as a result the system is more or less poisoned.
The first symptoms observed are the offensive odor,
the reddish discharge and the decrease in the milk
flow.</p>

<p>If the afterbirth does not come away of itself,
assistance is necessary. Do this during the first
or second day, or the third day at the latest. To
remove the afterbirth, tie up the cow and fasten
her in a way that she cannot jump around. Now
introduce the hand and arm, after careful washing
and disinfecting and oiling, into the uterus and
gradually and gently break the buttons or attachments
from the walls of the uterus with the fingers.
With patience these will come away and the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page233">[233]</span>
membrane be removed. An occasional injection is
advisable. Use some good disinfectant in the
water, flush out thoroughly.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref178">PLEURISY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This disease occurs in the chest
cavity and is found inside the ribs and over the
lungs. It is caused very much in the same way as
inflammation of the lungs, like exposure to cold,
standing in a draft, and cooling when warm. Some
injury to the ribs may also cause the trouble.</p>

<p>In the early stages the animal is noticed to
shiver, the pulse is quick and strong, and there is
great pain. The breath is heavy, and this is noticed
as far back as the flanks. While the animal may
lie down, its disposition is to stand up most of the
time. There is an inclination to cough, but this is
suppressed, because of the pain occasioned by it;
therefore the cough really ends in a groan rather
than in a normal cough. The extremities of the
body become cold.</p>

<p>The best treatment endeavors to prevent the
disease from developing. Do just as you would in
a case of inflammation of the lungs. Mustard
plasters for the chest on each side are good. Keep
the body well covered, including the legs and neck;
have good ventilation in the stable, but keep the
patient out of any draft.</p>

<p>As soon as the disease is noticed, mix the following
in a pint of cold water, and give as a drench:
Ten drops of aconite, a half teaspoonful of belladonna
and two tablespoonfuls of laudanum. These
should be given every two hours until the pain subsides.
If the animal seems to be weak, and needs
a stimulant, give 4 tablespoonfuls of spirits of niter
and a half glass of whiskey. This may be given in
a pint of cold water mixed with the gruel and given
as a drench three or four times a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span></p>

<p>At the same time use the following medicine to
improve the kidney action: One-fourth pound of
saltpeter or nitrate of potash and one-fourth of a
pound of gentian root. These are to be mixed well
together and a teaspoonful given three or four
times daily. Soft foods are desirable. A small
amount of water should be given frequently. Small
quantities at a time are preferable to large quantities
at infrequent intervals.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref179">PLEURO-PNEUMONIA.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This is a very contagious
disease of cattle introduced in this country
from Europe. At one time it was a very serious
menace to the cattle industry. Thanks to the very
aggressive work of the United States Department
of Agriculture, the disease has, so far as is known,
been eradicated from this country. No cases of the
disease have been reported during the past dozen
years.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref181">POLL EVIL.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A swelling or soreness at the top
of the head. Usually it is caused by an injury, like
bumping the head in a doorway, or from a bruise
made by the halter or bridle. It is first noticed by
a swelling or soreness, which frequently causes
trouble by forming an abscess; sometimes this
works down and even affects the bone. Treatment
is very simple if handled in time. Remove the
cause and then bathe with warm water and vinegar
twice a day and apply a liniment of some kind. If
the abscess is formed, it should be opened with a
knife at the lowest point to remove the matter.
From now on for a few days bathe the opening with
warm water in which has been added some carbolic
acid or creolin. If the case causes much trouble, you
had better consult a veterinarian, as bad cases frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span>
leave the neck stiff so that the animals are
not able to eat off the ground.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref183">QUITTOR.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A name given to a fistulous opening
upon the heels and quarters of the coronary
band, and is caused by treads, pricks in shoeing,
bruises, and suppurating corns. Any injury which
will cause suppuration within the foot will usually
cause matter to form at
the coronet, and may result
in quittor. The disease
is indicated by a
swelling upon the coronet
where the hair and hoof
meet, great lameness, and
a discharge of thin or
thick curdy pus. There
may be one or a number
of small openings leading
down into the sensitive
part of the foot. The
parts surrounding the
quittor swell and become
hard and take on an unhealthy
action and are
difficult to cure, and may be permanently diseased.</p>

trouble may result.</p>
</div>

<p>Clean the foot and put it into a bran poultice for
several days, then remove any horn that may be
pressing on the sore part. If it is at the heel remove
the crust with a knife; if it is in front of the
hoof rasp it thin. Then probe the opening at the
top to find the depth and direction. Put a grain
of bichloride of mercury into tissue paper and roll
it into a cone and press it down to the bottom of
the opening. Treat all the openings in the same
way. Put the foot into a bag to protect it from<span class="pagenum" id="Page236">[236]</span>
injury and let it alone for three days, then clean
out the openings and put in some more of the bichloride
of mercury, and so on for two weeks, or
until the parts become healthy and the hard swelling
has decreased; then make up a bath of chloride
of zinc one ounce, cool water one gallon; put the
foot into this twice a day for twenty minutes at a
time. As soon as the openings are healed blister
the coronet with the following: Mix 2 teaspoonfuls
of cantharides with 4 tablespoonfuls of lard; repeat
in two weeks if necessary. When it is time to put
on the shoe and work the horse, a bar shoe will be
best. If the animal has much fever in the early
stages of the disease give a dose of aloes, and follow
this by giving 2 tablespoonfuls of nitrate of potassium
twice a day in bran mash. Later in the disease
give a teaspoonful of sulphate of iron once a
day in bran mash as a tonic.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref184">RABIES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref129">Hydrophobia</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref185">RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A disease which affects the
muscles or joints, wandering from one part of the
body to another. It affects nearly all animals, including
the horse, ox, dog, hog, and sheep. Rheumatism
of the muscles is usually due to catching
cold, while rheumatism of the joints is often due
to some micro-organism.</p>

<p>Stiffness, which usually comes on suddenly, is a
characteristic symptom. The animal may be able
to move only with great difficulty. The joints may
crack when moved, the affected muscles are hard
and painful to touch, the soreness may shift from
one part to another; and the animal sometimes
makes a quick recovery, only to be followed by
another attack in a short time or perhaps never
again. These symptoms may be associated with
a rise in body temperature and increased pulse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span>
The disease may last for a long time or only for a
few days. In chronic cases the muscles decrease in
size in the parts affected. In the dog it is very
painful when caused to move and he will howl,
or even howl when he thinks he is going to be
moved. In sheep it seldom occurs except in young
lambs. Pigs are often affected in the legs or back,
sometimes becoming paralyzed in the hind legs.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref186">Rheumatism of the Joints</h4>

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;usually shows very
rapid swelling, increased heat, and is very painful.
The animal is often so lame that it will not put any
weight on the foot of the affected limb.</p>

<p>For horses and cows, treatment consists of local
applications of alcohol 50 parts and oil of mustard
1 part, rubbing it in well; or spirits of camphor.
Give at the same time internally 1 teaspoonful of
potassium iodide twice daily and not to exceed 12
doses; or salicylate of soda 4 tablespoonfuls daily.
Keep the animal warm and in a well-ventilated
stable. Pigs or dogs, according to size, should be
given from 4 to 16 grains of salol, also using the
above local applications.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref187">RINGBONE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A growth of bone on the pastern
bone, just above the hoof. It causes lameness when
it interferes with the joint or the passage of any of
the tendons. Some horses are predisposed to bony
diseases from the least injury, while others are not,
and in selecting mares for breeding purposes the
former should be rejected. This disease results
from strains, bruises, or injuries to the cartilage of
the joints. When the membrane of the bone or
cartilage becomes inflamed there may be great
lameness for several months before any enlargement
takes place, and it is somewhat difficult to
detect. The absence of other diseases of the foot,
with some heat in the pasterns, and soreness on<span class="pagenum" id="Page238">[238]</span>
pressure or moving the joints indicates this disease.
In other cases the enlargement may make
its appearance for some time before the horse becomes
lame, and in some cases it may never cause
any lameness, but should always be looked upon
with suspicion, as in the majority of cases it sooner
or later causes lameness. Ringbone is more difficult
to cure on the fore feet than on the hind
ones, as the pasterns are more upright on the former
than on the latter, and, besides, the horse&#8217;s fore
legs have to bear two-thirds the weight of the body.</p>

<p>The horse should have rest, and the shoes should
be removed and the foot pared level. If there is
heat in the part, keep it wet with the following
lotion by means of a bandage saturated with it:
Acetate of lead half an ounce and water one quart.
Continue this for a few days, then apply a blister
composed of cantharides 2 teaspoonfuls, biniodide
of mercury 1 teaspoonful and lard 8 tablespoonfuls.
Rub on a third of this with the fingers. It is not
necessary to cut off the hair if the blister is well
rubbed in. Let it remain on for 24 hours, then
wash off and rub on a little lard. Repeat every
second week until three blisters have been applied.
Keep the horse&#8217;s head tied while the blister is on
so that he cannot get his mouth to the part. The
horse should have a few months&#8217; rest after this
treatment. If it does not cure the animal it is best
to have him fired by a qualified veterinarian.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref188">RINGWORM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This is common in the domestic
animals, especially in calves and young cattle, and
is contagious. It depends upon the presence of a
vegetable parasite, which develops and grows
rapidly when it finds a suitable place for development.
Ringworm may affect any part of the body,
but its favorite seat is around the eyes, the face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page239">[239]</span>
ears, and neck of cattle, and sometimes the back
and hindquarters.</p>

<p>A gray crust appears on the skin, and the hair
drops out. This keeps spreading in the form of a
ring until around the eyes, the side of the face, ears,
or neck may be covered with it. It appears in the
same way on the back, hips, and inside of the hind
legs. It does not seem to affect the health of the
animal, as it is found in the well-kept as well as
those poorly kept.</p>

<p>First remove the crusts by washing with warm
water in which one ounce of carbonate of potassium
has been put to every quart of water. A
brush should be used in washing the parts. Then
use the following: Iodine 2 teaspoonfuls and vaseline
4 tablespoonfuls. Rub a little of this on with
a gloved hand. Repeat in three days. Or mix
carbolic acid 1 ounce with 2 ounces of alcohol and
apply a little of this to the parts with a feather once
or twice; this last is very effective.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref189">ROARING.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A disease, due to the wasting of the
larynx; is characterized by loud, unnatural sounds
after any violent exertion. The disease sometimes
follows distemper and influenza or a local injury to
the throat. Once established the disease is incurable.
In its early stages repeated light blisters may
help. A common blister can be made of a half teaspoonful
of cantharides, a half teaspoonful of
biniodide of mercury and 4 tablespoonfuls of vaseline
or lard.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref190">ROUP.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A disease of the mucous membrane in
fowls. It is of the nature of an inflammation, with
a discharge from the eyes and nostrils usually accompanying.
Damp and unsanitary quarters favor
the development and spread of roup. It is clearly
a germ disease, and, therefore, contagious. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span>
spread by means of infected quarters and fowls.
All discharges must be destroyed by disinfection,
and the diseased fowls quarantined off by themselves.
The dead should be burned. Keep the
quarters light and airy; admit an abundance of
sunshine and fresh air. Feed wholesome, nutritious
food, that the poultry stock may ward off the
disease. The best treatment is that which prevents
spreading to healthy fowls. If an outbreak
occurs, disinfect thoroughly, liberally, and continuously.
Antiseptics administered about the head
will usually break up the disease. Creolin is good&mdash;say,
1 part to 100 parts of water. Kerosene is also
recommended.</p>

<p>In a sense, roup is the result of neglected colds.
The birds sneeze, and manifest their uneasiness as
animals do with common colds. A teaspoonful
of pure carbolic acid to each gallon of drinking
water is an excellent preventive and can be provided
at small cost.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref191">SAND CRACK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A crack found in any part of
the wall of the foot. The crack is due to over-exertion.
When the hoof is dry and hard and brittle,
the crack usually begins at the top and extends
downward. Frequently the sensitive tissue creeps
into the crack, causing pain, and from which blood
frequently issues. When a crack is first seen, the
feet should be poulticed with linseed meal for a few
days. This will remove the inflammation and
soften the hoof. The next step will be to pare out
a piece of the hoof at the top, separating it completely
from the coronary band a half inch or so
on each side of the crack down to the quick. Fill
this hole with tar. A bar shoe attached so as not
to rest on the wall where the crack is located is
very helpful.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref192">SCAB IN CATTLE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Scab or itch, sometimes
called mange of cattle, is caused by a minute mite
that lives upon the surface of the skin, burrowing
into it. Other animals are not attacked by this
parasite, although a similar one does afflict sheep.
So long as cattle are doing well on grass, no disturbance
is noticed. As soon, however, as they
are placed on dry food and cold weather sets in,
the disease appears, and, if the cattle do poorly,
develops into a very aggravating form. Old
cattle are less troubled, the attacks being more
frequently on calves and yearlings and two-year-olds
out of condition. In the early stages the itching
of the skin in the region of the neck or shoulders
is first noticed. This is indicated by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span>
animals digging at the skin with teeth and horns
and the constant rubbing against posts or barbed
wire or anything that may give relief at the time.
The disease gradually spreads along the back, sides
and outside of legs. In the early stages the coat
looks rough, the skin has a scurvy appearance. In
time, the hair comes off or is rubbed off, presenting
bald patches of thick, glazed and wrinkled skin. After
the hair comes off the parasites leave these regions,
seeking other quarters and then the hair grows in
again. There is a dejected and debilitated condition
in animals thus afflicted and they fail rapidly in
flesh. Their appetites are poor and most of their
time is expended in scratching themselves.</p>

<p>Scab spreads rapidly through a bunch of cattle,
especially if they are not thrifty, and disseminates itself
through a herd in four to six weeks. The thrifty,
vigorous animals resist the infection for some time,
but they gradually succumb. The disease is spread
by direct contact and by contact with infected quarters.
While the mites will live a week or ten days
in protected places, they are almost immediately
destroyed by direct sunlight. As soon as the disease
is discovered in a bunch of cattle, the infected
animal should be isolated and the infected quarters
and rubbing posts disinfected with a 5 per cent
solution of carbolic acid. Infected animals should
be well fed and cared for, and be salted with a mixture
of 1 pound of flowers of sulphur mixed with
10 pounds of common salt. External treatment is
necessary to affect a cure. If a large number of
cattle are affected, a dipping wash through which
the animals must swim in the dip is the best means
for destroying the mites.</p>

<p>The most efficient remedies, considering cost, are
the coal tar products advertised as dip solutions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span>
A homemade dip that is both cheap and effective
for treating a small number of animals may be
made of 3 pounds of flowers of sulphur, 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> pounds
of unslaked lime, 15 gallons of water. In making
this unslaked lime into a thick paste, sift in the
sulphur and stir well. Put this mixture in a kettle
with, say, five gallons of water and boil for at least
half an hour&mdash;a longer time is better. When the
chocolate-looking mass settles, the clear liquid is
drawn off and water enough is added to make 15
gallons. The dip will be more effective if used
when warm, just a bit hotter than the normal heat
of the body. After the animals are dipped, they
should remain in the solution about two minutes.
This will be time enough to thoroughly saturate
the scabs and destroy them. A couple of ablutions
are required for complete eradication.
When no treatment is resorted to, the dip should
be applied with a scrubbing brush, cloth or sponges
and all scabs and crusts should be thoroughly
saturated. Warm sunny days are preferable for
this kind of work.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref193">SEPTIC NAVEL INFECTION.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A diseased
condition at the attachment of the navel cord soon

apply some septic powder to the navel at the breaking
point. If trouble arises, apply a solution of
carbolic acid, 1 part to 20 parts of water, after
using some hydrogen peroxide. A little iodoform
and alum, mixed half and half, make a good dusting
powder to use also.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;On either side of the coffin bone
there is a cartilage which may in certain cases become
hardened by deposits of mineral matters,
which may thus lead to lameness. Side bones are<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
situated on one or both sides of the leg and bulge
above the upper portion of the hoof. They may
be the result of inflamed conditions, bruises or
troubles like corns or hoof cracks. Slipping on
the stony pavement is a frequent cause, as well as
the great weight of the bodies in heavy horses. If
the wagon tongue
falls on the foot at
this point, the cartilage
may be injured
and induce the
disease. The swelling
is first noticed
just above the hoof
or near the heel.
Lameness soon follows.</p>

</div>

<p>The treatment
usually recommended
for side bones
consists in the free
use of cold foot
baths or cold water
bandages for a week
or more. Tincture
of iodine applied to
the swollen parts is very good. A blister applied
after the water applications have been
made for a week or so, is used by many veterinarians.
The blister is made of 2 teaspoonfuls of
cantharides mixed with 4 tablespoonfuls of lard. It
is rubbed in well with the fingers and allowed to
remain for 24 hours, when it is washed off and
applied a second time the following week. These
applications are continued until the lameness disappears.
If this does not bring permanent relief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>

rest will be necessary.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref196">SLOBBERING.</h3>

then washing the mouth out with alum water. If
a change is not observed soon, give a good physic.
For horses use 8 teaspoonfuls of bitter aloes, a teaspoonful
of common soda and a teaspoonful of
ginger. Mix these in a pint of water and give as a

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref198">SPAVIN.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This disease, known in common
language as bone spavin, is an enlargement of the
hock joint similar to a ringbone about the coronary
joint. It may affect the hock joint in such a way
as to cement the small joints together, not causing
lameness, and apparently no blemish, but the
free movement of the limb is impaired. Any condition
which favors sprains, such as fast driving
over hard or uneven roads, unequal paring of the
hoof, thus causing the weight to be unequally distributed
in the joints, and severe labor in early life,
or blows, bruises, or any injuries to tendons, ligaments,
or joints may cause spavin. In addition
to these causes may be mentioned sprains caused
by jumping, galloping, or trotting animals faster
than they are accustomed to; also straining by
starting a heavy load, slipping on an icy surface or
sliding on a bad pavement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span></p>

<p>If the patient is examined before any bony growth
has developed, inflammation will be detected on
the inside of the hock joint at the junction of the
cannon bone and the joint. While in the stable
the horse prefers to rest the diseased leg by setting
the heel on the toe of the opposite foot with the
hock joint flexed. In traveling the patient is very
lame when first taken out of the barn, but after
traveling for a short distance goes sound. The
diseased leg is not lifted clear from the ground, but
nicks the toe in the middle of the stride, which is
very noticeable on a pavement. A strained horse
becomes very lame after being allowed to stand for
even a very short time, then moved again.</p>

<p>Preventive treatment consists in keeping horses&#8217;
feet trimmed properly, not overworking colts while
young, careful driving on hard or uneven roads,
and avoiding all injuries that are liable to strain
tendons, ligaments or joints of the limbs. Even
after a spavin has developed it may be cured by
proper treatment of the feet, and applying a fly
blister. The fly blister is prepared by mixing
thoroughly 4 tablespoonfuls of pulverized cantharides,
4 tablespoonfuls of biniodide of mercury and
8 ounces of lard. The hair is clipped over the
spavin and the blister applied with considerable
rubbing. The horse&#8217;s head should be tied so as to
avoid his biting the part blistered. A second application
of the blister is to be used about a month
after the first. If blistering fails to cure the spavin,
point-firing may be resorted to. It is necessary to
&#8220;fire&#8221; rather deeply to secure good results, care
being taken not to fire into a joint. After firing, a
fly blister should be rubbed into the holes where
the hot iron has been used.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref199">SPAYING.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The removal of the ovaries to prevent
breeding. Cast the animal on her right side.
Give an anesthetic to prevent pain. When the
animal is unconscious, free the limbs sufficiently to
remove any pressure from the abdomen. Now
pinch up a fold of the skin in the left side, midway
between the prominent bone of the haunch or
pelvis, and the last rib, about 4 inches below the
backbone. Make an incision in the skin 5 or 6
inches long; now do likewise with the abdominal
muscles until the lining membrane of the abdominal
cavity is exposed. This membrane is then punctured
and an incision made as long as that in the
skin and muscles. Now kneel down in close contact
with the cow&#8217;s back and insert the arm, passing the
hand within the brim or cavity of the pelvis. By
so doing both ovaries can be secured and detached.
This ended, the operation of uniting the abdominal
muscles follows by means of stitches and sutures.</p>

<p>Great care is necessary in having the instruments
boiled and washed in antiseptics, and in having the
fingers, hands, and arms severely clean and well
saturated with a strong antiseptic solution. The
operation should be made out in the open where
neither dirt nor dust are to be found. Extreme
care about germs will remove much of the risk
associated with the operation.</p>

<p>In spaying a sow, she is laid on an inclined board
with the hindquarters up. The operator stands at
the back of the sow. The hair is first clipped from
the skin where the incision is to be made, high up
in the flank and midway between the haunch and
the last rib. The incision needs to be just large
enough to admit the two fingers. Ovaries are
located, pulled through the opening in the flank,
and removed by tearing off with the fingers. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span>
flank incision is then closed by the necessary number
of stitches.</p>

<p>This operation is sometimes performed in mares.
But being rather uncommon the process is less
understood. In this case it is best to call your veterinarian
or someone in the community well skilled
in the operation. In all cases of spaying let severe
cleanliness be the rule and practice, from the very
beginning to the very end.</p>

<p class="caption main">SPLINT</p>
</div>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref200">SPLINTS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Splints occur more commonly in the
heavier breeds of horses than in those that are light
in the bone below the knee. It
is rare that splints occur anywhere
except on the inside of
the front cannon bone, although
they are sometimes seen on the
outside of both the front and
hind legs. Any enlargement of the
bone occurring on the inside of the
leg between the knee and fetlock
comes under the name of splint.
The usual cause is concussion, that
is, the impact of the foot on the
hard road. It may be the result of
other causes, such as a blow, a
twisting strain or faulty conformation.
Some animals are more liable
to splints than others. It is, after
all, to a certain extent, dependent
upon heredity. At first the splint is
hard to detect. If you notice a
young horse going lame while doing
road work, it is well to examine for
splints. While working there seems
to be no lameness at all, and when
standing there seems to be no pain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span>
but when put to a trot the horse shows lameness
and may raise and lower his head.</p>

<p>If taken in time, a splint can be cured. The first
thing to do with an animal suffering from a splint
is to give the animal rest and place in such quarters
where there is a soft floor, preferably the
ground, and when so quartered one very frequently
effects a complete cure. The application of cold
water bandages acts well. If treatment of this sort
fails, apply a blister of red iodide of mercury, 1
tablespoonful to 2 tablespoonfuls of lard. This
blister should be applied with rubbing every day
from two to four days, or until the area is well
blistered. Then wait until the little scabs fall off,
and if the animal is still lame, repeat the application
of this blister. To apply the blister, clip off the
hair over the enlargement and wash with vinegar
to remove grease, then rub in blister with ends of
fingers. Keep the animals tied short for two to
four days in order to prevent rubbing or biting the
leg. Four days after the last application of blister,
wash carefully with warm water and soap and over
it apply every day or so a little lard, to prevent drying
and also to loosen the scabs.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref201">SPRAINS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Injuries to the ligaments of joints,
tendons, or muscles. They are caused by violence,
as twisting, or from over-exertion; also sprains are
often the result of overwork. If an animal is
worked until tired or exhausted he is unable to use
the proper muscle force, and more strain has to be
borne by the ligaments, resulting in sprains, which
often occur in young horses or even in old horses,
when put to work after long periods of rest.
Swelling, heat, soreness, and partial or complete
loss of the use of the part, which is shown by the
degree of lameness, characterize the disorder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span>
Sprains are most common in the legs, at the fetlock
joint, in the tendons just back and above the
fetlocks, but may occur in any part.</p>

<p>The first and most important thing in the treatment
of sprains is rest, as sprains are a long time in making
a complete recovery. In the early stages, that
is, before swelling has taken place, applications of
cold water should be used, applications of hot
water, or hot packs of water, 1,000 parts, and bichloride
of mercury 1 part, are very good. This
will relieve the pain and reduce the swelling. Applications
of liniments are also very good. Should
there be great heat and soreness in the part, it is
well to use cold applications. Never blister in the
early stages. A blister may be used after the swelling
has gone down, and the part has become cold,
from two to four weeks after the injury occurred.
This should be followed by rest for some time after
all lameness has disappeared.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref202">STAGGERS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Staggers in horses is an affection
of the brain showing itself usually in one of two
forms&mdash;sleepy or stomach staggers and blind or
mad staggers. In the first form the stomach is at
fault. Sudden change of feed, moldy or dirty food
heavy work or fast driving right after a heavy meal
or severe exposure is liable to cause indigestion in
the stomach and this is reflected to the brain, causing
the animal to act dull or sleepy, sometimes
showing symptoms of serious colic, with gas forming
from the fermentation of the food, frequently
resulting in death.</p>

<p>Blind or mad staggers is an inflammation of the
brain and may affect any of the lower animals.
In the beginning of this form the symptoms closely
resemble those in the stomach form, but as the inflammation
progresses the animal becomes blind<span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span>
and violent and may roll, paw, kick, wander around
in a circle, usually going only one way, either to the
left or right, or it may walk or run in a straight line
as near as possible for hours at a time&mdash;paying no
attention to injuries received in its travels. In
either case the animal may be drenched once daily
with a quart of raw linseed oil or a pound of Glauber
salts, dissolved in water, which sometimes gives
relief.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref203">Staggers in Sheep</h4>

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;is mostly caused by the young
stage of a tapeworm which infests sheep dogs. The
dog eats the infected brain of the sheep and the
sheep eats the egg of the tapeworm after it has
passed through the dog. After the egg hatches in
the stomach of the sheep the young worm passes
through the bowels and other organs or tissues or
circulates through the blood and reaches the brain,
where it develops and causes an inflammation, resulting
in disease. It is most common in young
animals, rarely occurring in sheep after their second
year.</p>

<p>Prevention is about the only practical way of
handling this trouble. The grounds should be
thoroughly drained, allowing the animals only pure,
fresh water to drink. It may be necessary to change
pastures for a year or two. The brains of all sheep
killed and the heads of all dying with the disease
should be burned.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref202a">STOMACH AND INTESTINAL WORMS IN
SHEEP.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;If a box of salt is kept covered in some
place frequented by the sheep, to which they are
allowed to help themselves, and if said salt is saturated
with spirits of turpentine in proportions of a
gill to every four quarts of salt, it will wonderfully
help to keep the worms from multiplying. It is
well, also, to have another box of larger size, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span>
sheep can help themselves at will, filled with
tobacco stems. These stems should be cut up in
inch lengths and from time to time a quantity of
wheat bran should be put on top of the stems.
When this is done the sheep soon instinctively
learn to use tobacco, and no young intestinal worm
or stomach worm, except the tapeworm, can stand
the diet. This will not kill mature worms. It will
only prevent the worm family multiplying to the
extent of injuring the health of sheep.</p>

<p class="caption main">TWISTED STOMACH WORMS</p>
<p class="caption sublong">A common attitude observed when sheep are afflicted
with twisted stomach worms. The animal loses in flesh, and
unless relief is found in time, dies. The parasite is shown
in the illustration.</p>
</div>

<p>But no sheep owner should feel wholly satisfied
by preventive treatment of stomach worms. Twice
a year the whole flock should be drenched with
some agent which will destroy the mature worms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span>
There are two very inexpensive drenches which
will quite effectually do this. The one is gasoline,
the other coal tar creosote. The objection to gasoline
is that it needs to be so extremely carefully
used or sheep will be killed by it. The dose is 1
tablespoonful (never more at one dose) to a mature
sheep; mix with not less than 4 tablespoonfuls of
raw linseed oil (never boiled oil); then add a half
pint of sweet milk. In giving, set the sheep up on
its haunches and shake the liquids well together
until the last minute it is administered, or the gasoline
will separate and, if it enters the stomach in
the unmixed form, it will seriously injure and may
kill the sheep.</p>

<p>There is no direct vermifuge that will as effectually
kill all species of worms in a sheep&#8217;s stomach
and intestines as will gasoline; yet the coal tar
creosote or the more refined class of sheep dips, if
given after a full 12-hour fast, before the flock is
turned to pasture in the spring, and again about
November, will destroy a large number of the
mature worms. All lambs born in April or May
should be drenched about August or September
following, to be certain of ridding them of worms
that may later cause their death. The dose of any
of the sheep dips is a dessertspoonful mixed in a
full pint of water.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref205">STRANGLES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This trouble, commonly called
colt distemper, affects horses, and rarely mules and
donkeys. It is such an infectious disease that
nearly all horses contract the disease when colts
and usually remain immune to future exposures.
The cause is a very small organism or germ which
enters the system when a healthy colt comes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
contact with a diseased one or when fed and
watered in infected vessels. The seat of trouble
is largely restricted to the respiratory organs, occasionally
causing difficulty in breathing, owing to
swelling in region of throat or to accumulations in
air passages.</p>

<p>The symptoms start out with more or less sluggishness.
The animal eats little, and does not
care to take much exercise. A little watery
discharge frequently appears from the eyes, and
about the same time a watery discharge from
the nostrils, which soon becomes thicker and
more yellow in color. Usually the glands between
the lower jawbones become enlarged and undergo
suppuration with a rupture of them and free discharge
of pus. The temperature of the animal may
be slightly or very greatly increased from 103&deg; to
105&deg;. The pulsations may also be considerably
quickened. When complications do not occur this
disease usually runs its course in two weeks, leaving
the animal little the worse for having passed
through the affliction.</p>

<p>The milder forms of this disease will need little
or no treatment other than careful feeding and nursing.
A laxative diet, with something green, if possible,
should be given. The colt should be placed
in clean, airy, and comfortable quarters, but not
in a draft. To hasten the suppuration of the
glands a poultice of hot bran or flaxseed may be
applied to that region, and as soon as softening can
be detected within, puncture the gland containing
abscess with a clean knife blade and allow the
escape of the collection of pus. During the course
of the disease the animal should not be worked and
care should be taken that it be not exposed to conditions
likely to produce a cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span></p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref206">STRINGHALT IN HORSES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Stringhalt is
an involuntary contraction of the muscles that
bring the hind leg or legs forward. The cause of
stringhalt is a deranged condition of the nerves
supplying the muscles, causing the leg or legs to
be brought up with a jerk. In slight cases of
stringhalt it is necessary sometimes to turn the
animal round from right to left, and from left to
right, in order to make him show signs of stringhalt,
the symptoms of the disease being exhibited as
he turns one way only. This disease sometimes
comes on suddenly, but generally develops slowly.
It is an unsoundness, and depreciates the animal&#8217;s
value and makes him unfit for hard work or fast
driving. There is no sure cure for stringhalt; the
animal can sometimes be relieved by giving him
one ounce bromide of potassium at a dose twice a
day in bran mash, and continuing it for one week,
then skipping a week and giving again. It can
sometimes be relieved by cutting the tendon or
tendons of the affected muscles, but the operation
should be performed by a qualified veterinarian.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref207">SUNSTROKE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref109">Heat Exhaustion and Sunstroke</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref208">SWAMP FEVER.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This disease, by some called
infectious anemia of horses, is produced by an invisible
organism, which is transmissible to horses,
mules, and asses. About the first symptoms noticed
are a general weakness of the animal; it tires very
easily and is not able to do any work. The loss of
flesh is apparent in spite of the voracious appetite
which the animal has at times. The appetite
usually remains good until death, but the feed
seems to do the animal no good. The temperature
is very irregular. Some days it runs quite high,
at times to 107&deg;; again it is below normal. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
animal may have several attacks of the trouble,
but each succeeding attack seems to be more severe.
The blood becomes thin, and the circulation impaired,
and frequently there appears a swelling
under the chest or abdomen, or an enlargement of
one or more legs. It is quite easy to recognize the
trouble, especially in the advanced stages. The
slow progress at the beginning, remittent fever,
progressive emaciation and anemia, unimpaired or
ravenous appetite, staggering gait, and excessive
urination are usually all present to a greater or less
degree. Recovery takes place only when treatment
is begun early and when the disease is not too acute.</p>

<p>In treating, absolute rest until fully recovered
is one of the primary requisites, and purgatives are
to be avoided. For the fever, the United States
Department of Agriculture recommends an antipyretic
of quinine 40 grains, acetanilide 2 drams, and
powdered nux vomica 30 grains, four times daily.
Cold water sponge baths and frequent copious
rectal injections of cold water also aid in reducing
the fever. After the fever subsides the following
is recommended: Arsenious acid, 2 grams; powdered
nux vomica, 28 grams; powdered cinchona
bark, 85 grams; powdered gentian root, 110 grams.
These should be well mixed and one-half teaspoonful
given at each feed of the affected animal.</p>

<p>As in the case of all other infectious diseases, the
healthy should be separated from the sick horses,
and thorough disinfection of the infected stable,
stalls, litter, and stable utensils should be used by
mixing six ounces of any one of these chemicals
with one gallon of water. One of the approved coal-tar
sheep dips might also be used to advantage in a
five per cent solution, and should be applied liberally
to all parts of the stable, and sufficient lime may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
added to the solution to make the disinfectant area
conspicuous.</p>

<p>From the fact that the disease is more prevalent
during wet seasons, it is always best to guard
against allowing the animals to graze upon swampy
land or to drink from ponds of stagnant water.
The spread of the disease has been traced along
creeks from one farm to another, which would
suggest avoiding these places also. The draining
of the low, swampy lands is especially recommended.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref209">SWEENY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Wasting of the muscles covering

&#8220;sweeny,&#8221; and the cause may be any strain,
sprain, jerk, or bruise of the parts due to a bad
fitting collar, or to awkward steps of a colt plowing
for the first time, and especially when worked in
the furrow. The great nerves of the shoulder are
affected, and in consequence nutrition is impaired
and the muscles waste away. A similar condition
may affect the muscles of the hip, or of the space
between the stifle and hip.</p>

<p>Lameness seldom is a prominent feature in
shoulder sweeny. Ordinarily the wasting comes
on some time after the causative injury; then the
skin alone appears to cover the bone (scapula) and
the animal may have little power for work. In this
connection it should be remembered that wasting
of the shoulder muscles also may be due to any
chronic lameness or soreness of the foot, or leg,
between foot and shoulder. Wasting (atrophy)
of muscles occurs when the muscles for any reason
are not fully exercised. It, therefore, is important
to make sure whether the cause is in the foot or
in the shoulder before commencing treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span></p>

<p>Treatment consists in stimulating flow of blood
to the poorly nourished parts, and if this can be
done the muscles gradually grow in again and regain
their normal development and power. An old-fashioned
plan is to make incisions in the skin and
then blow up the parts with air to separate the skin
from the bone. This should not be done. Setons
(rowels) of tape may be inserted under the skin,
but they leave scars. Better treatment consists in
rubbing the parts twice daily with a stimulating
liniment, or blistering at intervals of three weeks
with cerate of cantharides, after removing the hair.
A suitable liniment may be made by mixing
together four ounces of druggist&#8217;s soap liniment,
one ounce each of aqua ammonia and water to make
one pint.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref213">TEXAS OR TICK FEVER.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The earliest accounts
that we have of this disease date back to
1814. It was found that cattle driven from a certain
district in South Carolina to other parts of the
state would infect others with the disease, while
they themselves seemed to be in perfect health.
The disease is known by various names in the different
sections of the country. It is often called<span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span>
red water, Spanish fever, Australian tick fever, and
murain.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600p" id="Plate6">
<img src="images/plate6.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="421" />
<p class="caption main">A TYPICAL CASE OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE</p>
<p class="caption sublong">The disease shows itself about the mouth, the feet and the teats. When an
outbreak occurs all affected animals should be destroyed and all quarters thoroughly
disinfected.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a specific fever, and is characterized by
the peculiarity among animal diseases that animals
which scatter the infection are apparently in good
health, while those which sicken and die from it do
not, as a rule, infect others.</p>

<p>When the cattle are brought into the infected
districts they usually contract the disease during
the first of the summer, and if they are adult cattle,
particularly milch cows or fat cattle, nearly all die;
calves are more likely to survive. The disease is
one from which immunity is acquired, and, therefore,
calves which recover from the disease are not
again attacked, as a rule, even after they become
adult.</p>

<p>When the disease is prevalent or scattered beyond
the infected district the roads, barns and pastures
are dangerous until freezing weather, when
the disease disappears and cattle can be kept in
the grounds or driven over the roads without catching
the disease. The midwinter months is the only
time that cattle can be safely driven from an infected
area to a non-infected area without spreading
the disease.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref214">The Cause.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Texas fever is caused by an organism
which lives within the red-blood corpuscles and
breaks them up. It is not a bacteria, but a protozoa,
and belongs to the lowest forms of the animal
kingdom. How it gets into the blood corpuscles is
not known. The fatality is due not so much to the
loss of blood corpuscles as to the difficulty which
the organs have in getting rid of the waste products
arising from this wholesale destruction.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref215">The Course of the Disease.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;After a period of
exposure, which may vary from 13 to 90 days, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
disease first shows itself in dullness, loss of appetite
and a tendency to leave the herd and lie down
alone. A few days before these symptoms appear
the temperature rises from 103&deg; to 107&deg;. There is
little change in temperature until death or recovery.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref216">Pathological Changes Observable After Death.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The
presence of small ticks on the udder or
escutcheon is a very important sign in herds north
of the Texas fever line. The watery condition of
the blood. The spleen or milt very much enlarged,
and filled with a blackish pulp. Enlargement
of the liver, and its color changed to a
mahogany color. The distended gall-bladder,
caused by an excessive amount of bile in it.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref217">The Cattle Tick</h4>

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;(<i>Boophilus bovis</i>) is the carrier
of this disease. Its life history is quite simple. It
is unable to come to maturity and reproduce its
kind unless it becomes attached to the skin of cattle,
whence it may obtain its food. The eggs laid on
the ground by the female tick after falling off the
cattle begin to develop at once. The time required
for hatching varies considerably, according to the
temperature. In the heat of summer about 13 days,
and in the fall, under the same conditions, from
four to six weeks. On pastures these little creatures
soon find their way on to cattle. They
attach themselves, by preference, to the tender skin
on the escutcheon, the inside of the thighs, and on
the base of the udder. When very numerous they
may be found on various parts of the body. They
remain clinging to the cattle until mature, and then
fall off and lay their eggs and hatch more new
ticks.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref218">How Prevention Is Possible.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The spread of
Texas fever can be prevented by two ways&mdash;sanitary<span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span>
arrangements and by vaccination. Where the
cattle are infected with the tick, the ticks can be
killed by smearing the animals with a solution
capable of killing the ticks without harming the
cattle. In large herds a large vat of crude petroleum
is used to immerse the cattle in. In small
herds smear the cattle with a mixture of equal parts
of cottonseed oil and crude petroleum.</p>

<p>How to rid the pastures of the tick without killing
the vegetation on them has for a long time been
the problem. Divide the pasture in two parts by a
double parallel line of fence with a 10-foot space
between, to prevent ticks from crawling across.
One of these pastures is then kept free of cattle for
two winters and one summer. After the second
winter it will be free of ticks and ready for tickless
cattle, when the other pasture is abandoned for the
same time.</p>

<p>Vaccination is for the purpose of immunizing
cattle that are brought from a non-infected district
to an infected district. Calves about six to eight
months old should be used, as they are more immune
than adult cattle. The immunity is caused
by introducing the germ into the blood in a weakened
form. This may be done in two ways&mdash;by
placing virulent young ticks on the calves or by
artificial vaccination. When this is practiced, it
should be done in two or three inoculations, as it
gives better results. The intervals should be about
three weeks. The amount of virulent blood should
be small the first time and increased in the following
treatments.</p>

<p>The inoculation always results in a more or less
serious attack of the fever upon the animal treated.
Some may die, but the proportion of deaths resulting
among animals taken directly into the infected<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
district is large to the proportion of deaths resulting
from vaccination. Medical treatment for this
disease has proven unsatisfactory in the acute form,
although in some chronic cases some good results
may have been obtained by medical treatment.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;See <a href="#Ref155">Lymphangitis</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref220">THOROUGHPIN.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An enlargement situated
on the sides and upper part of the hock joint of the
horse, arising from a derangement of the sheath of
the back tendon. The fluid with which it is filled
can be pressed from one side to the other, hence
the term thoroughpin. It seldom causes lameness.
For treatment mix a teaspoonful of biniodide of
mercury with 4 tablespoonfuls of lard. Rub on a
little with the fingers, let it remain on for 24 hours,
then wash off and rub on a little lard or vaseline.
Repeat the blister every third week until the enlargement
disappears. The horse should have rest
while under treatment.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref221">THRUSH.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A diseased condition of the secreting
surface of the fatty frog in the foot. In severe
cases the horny part often detaches from the sensitive
tissue within. Bad shoeing is a common
cause of the trouble, or anything else that prevents
the frog from coming in contact with the ground.
Lameness is sometimes associated with the disease.
Treatment consists of careful cleaning, followed
with linseed meal poultices if lame. After the foot
is made dry, insert calomel into the little cavities.
The calomel can be kept in and the dirt kept out
by using paper or cloth plugs. Follow this treatment
until normal condition is attained.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref222">THUMPS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;This disease is limited in its action
to pigs. Its cause is not definitely known. It is recognized
by a peculiar contraction of the diaphragm
in young pigs. While the pig may eat fairly well<span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span>
the disturbance is associated with digestion. Such
patients like to lie around and take very little exercise.
The disease is more common where one kind
of food like corn is fed. The old common method
was to cut off the ear. The common practice now
is to give a purgative so as to relieve the stomach
and bowels of accumulated material. The food
should be changed and from 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of
Epsom salts should be given. The jerking movement
of the muscles may be relieved or stopped
by using laudanum, say, four drops to 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls
of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a half
pint of water.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref224">TRICHINOSIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;A disease caused by the trichina,
a minute worm that affects people, hogs and
rats. People become affected with the disease from
raw or partly cooked pork. These worms are
killed by thorough cooking or by the process of hot
pickling and curing meat products.</p>

<p>Hogs become affected through eating offal and
rats about the slaughterhouses. Hogs that are
fed on green grass and other wholesome food, free
from these minute worms, are less likely to have
trichin&aelig; embedded in their flesh and muscles. Hogs
do not seem to be bothered with the trichin&aelig;,
but people suffer very severely, as both soreness in
the muscles and fever result.</p>

<p>A few days after eating the trichin&aelig;, the worms
multiply very rapidly in the digestive tract, from
which they migrate to other parts of the body and
work their way through the tissues. There is no
remedy in way of treatment when affected. Prevention
is the one cure. Inasmuch as five to ten
per cent of hogs are affected, it is advisable that all<span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span>
pork or ham be eaten only after most thorough
cooking.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref225">TUBERCULOSIS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Tuberculosis is a disease
resulting from the growth of tubercle bacteria in
the tissues of the animal. The bacteria, or germs,
of tuberculosis, usually gain entrance to the organs
of the body by being taken in with the food. Sometimes
they penetrate through the membranes in the
throat and get into the
glands of the head. Sometimes
they are taken into
the digestive tract, where
they pass through the
walls of the intestines
into the lymph channels
and are carried through
the large lymph vessel
into the blood circulation.
In some cases it would
seem that the bacteria get
into the lungs on particles
of dust that are inhaled.</p>

<div class="figcenter w300p" id="Fig52">
<img src="images/illo264.png" alt="" width="300" height="303" />
<p class="caption main">TUBERCULOSIS GERMS</p>
<p class="caption sublong">These germs may be inhaled
in the lungs with the
air, admitted to the stomach
and intestines with food and
drink, or established in the
flesh by inoculation through
broken skin or mucous membrane.</p>
</div>

<p>After getting into the
body, tubercle bacteria
multiply in the tissues to
which they have been carried and produce the
changes in them which we find on the examination
of an animal suffering with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis,
therefore, is simply the outcome of the
growth of the tubercle bacteria in the organs.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref226">Where Tubercles Are to Be Found.</h4>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Tuberculous
areas may be found in almost any part of the
infected animal, but the organs that are usually affected
are the lymphatic glands, either in the throat,
the bronchial glands or those about the intestines
and on the liver; the lungs; the liver; the kidneys;<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>
intestines; udder and generative organs. The
membrane covering the lungs (pleura), the heart
(pericardium), and intestines (peritoneum), are
frequently affected. It often happens that a large
mass, or masses, of tuberculous tissue grow over
one or more of these membranes. The most peculiar
thing about bovine tuberculosis is the fact that
frequently an animal will appear to be perfectly
well, but when slaughtered will be found to have
a large number of tuberculous areas or masses on
the membranes or in its organs. The reason for
this is that the diseased area is not at a vital point.</p>

<p>The organ or membrane affected depends upon
the one to which the germ is carried. Usually
animals are infected in but one organ in the beginning,
and from this diseased area the germs
spread through the blood vessels or lymph channels
to other organs. When the diseased area is
restricted to one organ or part, it is called &#8220;localized&#8221;
tuberculosis, because it appears at the point
where the seed or germ was first planted. When
the germs spread through the circulation from
this first or primary diseased area to other organs
and set up new tuberculous growths, the condition
is called &#8220;generalized&#8221; tuberculosis. When
cattle are slaughtered for food, if they are found
to be afflicted with localized tuberculosis, the flesh
is considered to be fit for food, but if the disease
is generalized the carcass is condemned.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref227">The Symptoms of Tuberculosis</h4>

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;vary according to
the location of the disease. If it is in the glands of
the throat it is suggested by their enlargement. If
it is in a gland about the lungs, which, because of
its enlargement, presses on the &#339;sophagus (gullet),
there might be bloating. If the disease is in the
lung tissue there would be, after it is sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page266">[266]</span>
advanced, coughing and perhaps difficult breathing.
If the disease is in the liver, it cannot be readily
distinguished until it is far advanced. If the disease
is in the udder it manifests itself usually by
the organ becoming firm or hard, and when the
tissues are sufficiently broken down the milk from
that quarter will be changed in appearance; sometimes
it is thick, containing pus, sometimes thin
and watery. It is very difficult to diagnose tuberculosis
from the symptoms, as many other causes
may give rise to similar manifestations.</p>

<p>As tuberculosis is caused by a specific germ, the
disease is spread by the germs escaping from the
diseased animals and getting into the bodies of
healthy ones. The tubercle bacteria escape from
the infected animal with some one or more of the
natural discharges of the body. For example, if
the cow has a bad tuberculous area in the lung, the
bacteria may be discharged into one of the air tubes
and coughed up into the mouth. Some of them
will escape with the saliva and infect mangers or
pastures. Some of them may be swallowed and
escape from the body with the feces. If the disease
is in the udder the germs will escape with the
milk. There are some observations which indicate
that sometimes the bacteria will escape with the
milk where the udder is not affected. After the
bacteria leave the diseased animal and are left in
the manger, or in the pasture, or on the surface of
water in the drinking trough, they can be readily
taken up by healthy cattle that eat or drink after
them. If they escape with the milk, calves and
pigs that are fed with it readily become infected.
After the germs get into the body of the healthy
animal they will multiply and produce the disease,
just as the seed of a noxious weed will, if blown<span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span>
into a new field, germinate and produce the weed
there. Tuberculosis spreads from animal to animal
on the same principle that weeds spread from one
field to another.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the spread of tuberculosis it
is simply necessary to prevent healthy animals from
coming in contact with the diseased ones or eating
or drinking after them.</p>

<p>As tuberculosis cannot be readily detected by a
physical examination until the disease is far advanced
in the organs affected, it is necessary, in
order to determine which animals have the disease,
to apply some test or to find the germs of the disease
in their excretions. The simplest test that has
thus far been discovered is the action of tuberculin.
When tuberculin is injected under the skin
of the animals affected with active tuberculosis the
animals respond by a rise of temperature, which
follows a somewhat definite curve. By means of
this test it is possible to pick out the infected individuals
so that they can be separated from the
healthy ones. The test should be repeated in from
six months to a year in order to detect any new
cases which might have developed from latent or
arrested ones. We cannot always get all of the
infected animals with the first test any more than
we can always remove every weed from the garden
by one hoeing.</p>

<h4 class="inline" id="Ref228">The Bang Method for the Control</h4>

<p class="noindent">&nbsp;of tuberculosis
consists in separating the animals that are infected
from the well ones and keeping them for breeding
purposes. The calves are removed from their dams
as soon as born and fed with the milk of healthy
cows, or the pasteurized milk of the infected ones.
It has been found that but a small percentage of
calves that are raised under proper precautions from<span class="pagenum" id="Page268">[268]</span>
such animals have tuberculosis. By this means a
sound herd of cattle may be developed from tuberculous
animals. This method was introduced by
Prof. Bang of Copenhagen, and it has been found
to be very effective in Denmark and other countries
in Europe. It has been applied with much success
in a large number of individual herds in the United
States. Its success depends entirely upon the care
which is taken in keeping tubercle bacteria away
from the calves.</p>

<p>In purchasing cattle for dairy or breeding purposes
it is important that they should be taken
from herds that are free from tuberculosis. The
sound herd is the unit to be dealt with. Animals
from such herds are far more reliable than non-reactors
from tuberculous herds.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref229">TUMORS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Abnormal growths of tissues. There
are many kinds of tumors. They are named from
the kind of tissue of which they are composed,
as fibrous and fatty. Just why tumors should develop
is not known. Treatment is in the direction
of direct removal; this means they are to be cut
out with a knife. Another method is to tie a strong
cord around the stem of the tumor, thus shutting
off the blood supply. As soon as this is effected,
there will be a sloughing away, with a sore remaining,
which is to be treated as in an ordinary wound.
Some tumors are burnt off with caustics. Arsenic
or corrosive sublimate are commonly used, either
singularly or combined. Better consult a veterinarian
about the removal of tumors on valuable
animals.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref230">TUMORS IN PIGS AFTER CASTRATION.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Bunches
form on the cords of pigs after castration
as a result of infection from dirty instruments or
hands during the operation; or from leaving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page269">[269]</span>
cord too long, thus increasing the liability of its
becoming infected. These tumors continue to
grow, and in the worst cases attain the size of a
man&#8217;s head. Cut down on a tumor the same as
in a simple case of castration. Separate the skin
from the tumor and then swallow up the cord with
the hands. Cut the cord off as high up as possible.
The wound may be healed by the use of any of the
common disinfectants. A teaspoonful of carbolic
acid in a quart of water may be used once daily
until the pigs are healed. Pigs should be kept in
a clean pen after the operation.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref231">WARBLES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;These are lumps in the skin of
cattle, caused by grubs or warbles. A simple treatment
is to cut the skin and squeeze out the grubs
where the lumps are noticed. If all the grubs are
killed in this way, there will be no mature flies to
cause trouble later on. See article on <a href="#Ref26">Bot Flies</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref232">WARTS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;The cause of these little tumors of the
skin is not definitely known. They occur on all
domestic animals, appearing most frequently on
horses and cattle. Pure acetic acid, dropped on
the wart until it is saturated and softened, destroys
in the early stages. Warts about which a
small cord may be tied are most easily treated in
that way. After they have sloughed off, apply a
little terchloride of antimony with a feather or cotton.
When the scab forms, remove it and apply
the chemical again. With a couple of applications
the spot will be lower than the surrounding skin.
Now use an ointment, made of 4 tablespoonfuls of
oxide of zinc and 8 tablespoonfuls of lard. Apply
this daily until the sore spot is healed. Sometimes
a form of warts suddenly appears on colts and
calves and scatter themselves about the lips, nose<span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span>
and face. They are common and appear and disappear
suddenly. No treatment is necessary.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref233">WATER IN THE BRAIN.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Dropsy in the
brain. A condition characterized by an accumulation
of fluid in the brain. The disease is either
congenital or arises during the first years of life.
When it occurs the best thing is to kill the young
individual at once.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref234">WATER IN THE CHEST.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Often after a case
of pleurisy a reaction comes and a very large quantity
of water settles in the chest cavity, anywhere
from two to four pailfuls. When the disease comes
on the animal has difficulty in breathing; takes in
the breath quickly. There is a constant biting at
the flanks; the pulse increases to a hundred beats
a minute. If you place your ear over the chest
you will likely hear no sound at all. Best treatment
is wholesome food, boiled flaxseed, and blisters
for both sides of the chest. Use strong mustard
plasters. A good medicine to use is one-fourth of
a pound of saltpeter or nitrate of potash, one
fourth of a pound of ground gentian and one-fourth
of a pound of sulphate of iron. These should be
mixed and then 1 teaspoonful given every four
hours. You had better consult a veterinarian. Other
complications set in so readily that help may be
secured in other ways. Some veterinarians puncture
the chest so as to draw off the surplus water
that has accumulated.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref235">WHITE SCOURS OF CALVES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Calves of
several days or weeks old suffer from indigestion,
which is indicated by thriftlessness, and then scouring.
The discharges are white, sour, curdled and frequent
at first and then become watery, greenish and
offensive, passing in stream often. Calves live some<span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span>
days and fast lose flesh, showing all the symptoms
of ill health.</p>

<p>One of the commonest causes is feeding dirty,
souring or decomposing factory skim milk in large
quantities at long intervals; even sweet skim milk
so fed may produce the trouble. To prevent scours
give calves a perfectly clean, airy, sunny pen and
yard attached. Separate any calf that scours.
Avoid dirty, dark, damp, poorly ventilated pens in
which scouring calves have been. Give all food
from clean, scalded, sun-dried vessels. Feed small
quantities of food often; and in milk mix lime water
freely two or three times a week as a preventive;
and daily when scouring has been experienced.
Also see that the udders of cows nursing calves
do not become contaminated with manure or other
filth.</p>

<p>Wash udders with a two per cent solution of coal
tar disinfectant before any calf is allowed to suck
for the first time, and then repeat to keep the udders
clean. Also disinfect the navel of each calf at birth
with a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>500</sub> solution of corrosive sublimate and
repeat the application twice a day until the navel
is perfectly healed over. At the first sign of scours
give castor oil shaken up in milk. Two to 6 tablespoonfuls
is the dose according to the size and age of
the calf. Follow two or three times daily with a 1 to
2-teaspoonful dose of a mixture of one part of salol
and two parts of subnitrate of bismuth in milk or
water. For calves scouring on skim milk mix in
each pint of milk 1 teaspoonful of a mixture of half
an ounce of formaldehyde in 15<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> ounces of distilled
water, to be kept in an amber-colored bottle.</p>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;An accumulation of synovia in
the cavities between the tendons of the legs, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span>
between the back tendons and the bone just
above the fetlock joint. The bulging out is on
each side of the tendon. Horses subjected to
severe exertions, like hard work on the roads, are
most frequently affected. The puffs or galls seldom
cause lameness or interfere with the usual
work. Unless treated the puffs will become thicker
and harder and sometimes solidified. When this
happens lameness occurs. In the early stages,
pads and bandages, if applied so as to cause pressure,
will tend to remove the galls. If this treatment
is not sufficient, then use a teaspoonful of
biniodide of mercury, and 4 tablespoonfuls of lard.
When mixed, these should be rubbed on with the
fingers. After 24 hours remove with water and
soap and repeat every other week until the puffs
disappear.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="Ref240">WORMS IN HOGS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;Hogs with worms in the
intestines run down in condition, become very thin
and lank, back is arched, eyes dull, refuse feed,
walk stiffly, and appear lifeless. The worms may
be very numerous, in bad cases completely filling
the intestines. The pigs die if not treated. To
secure the best results, affected hogs should receive
individual treatment. Twenty-four hours before
administering treatment very little feed should
be given them. Then give the following medicine
as a drench to each 100-pound hog; larger or smaller
hogs should receive a dose in proportion: 4 tablespoonfuls
of oil of turpentine, one-half teaspoonful
of liquor ferri dialysatus and 6 ounces of raw linseed
oil. If necessary, repeat the dose in four
days.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
